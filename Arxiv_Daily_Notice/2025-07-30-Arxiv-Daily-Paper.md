 - **Abstract**
 The globular cluster Palomar 5 (Pal 5) is in the process of being tidally shredded as it orbits the Milky Way. Its core is currently at a heliocentric distance of ~21 kpc, near apogalacticon (~18 kpc), and it reaches ~5-7 kpc at perigalacticon. Pal 5's leading and trailing arms stretch over 20 degrees on the sky, making them sensitive probes of the Milky Way's mass distribution. In this work, we search for red giant members of Pal 5 using spectroscopic data from APOGEE DR17 and photometric and astrometric data from Gaia DR3. Based on position and proper motion, we identify eight members of Pal 5: six in the core and two in the stream. The clustering algorithm HDBSCAN finds these same eight. We then use chemical tagging with APOGEE abundances to search for additional members across five APOGEE fields overlapping Pal 5. While several dozen candidates are identified, most deviate (some significantly) from known kinematic and color-magnitude trends, suggesting that they are less likely to be true members. We estimate the expected number of giants in the APOGEE pointings based on the area and stellar mass of the streams. Given APOGEE's limiting magnitude, we find that few, if any, new giants are expected, especially if the stream is more diffuse at these locations. Our results support the presence of density variations in Pal 5's tidal streams, consistent with earlier studies attributing such features to baryonic perturbers in the Milky Way, dark matter subhaloes, or interactions with passing globular clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first CO detection in Leo T, representing the most extreme observation of carbon monoxide molecules in the lowest stellar mass gas-rich dwarf galaxy ($M_{\star}$$\sim$10$^5$ M$_{\odot}$) known to date. We acquired and present new Atacama Compact Array (ACA) $^{12}$CO($J$=1-0) data within our CHIMERA Survey project for the central region of Leo~T, a metal-poor ([M/H]$\sim$-1.7) dwarf in the Milky Way (MW) outskirts. We identified three compact molecular clouds ($<13$ pc) with estimated upper limit virial masses of $M_{\rm mol}$$\sim$5$\times10^{3}$ M$_{\odot}$ each and a total of 1.4$\pm$0.4$\times$10$^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$, corresponding to $\sim\!3\%$ of the total gas mass. We obtained CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factors ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$) as high as $\sim$155 M$_{\odot}$ $({\rm K\, km\, s^{-1}\, pc^2})^{-1}$ and mean molecular gas surface densities of $\Sigma_{\rm mol}$$\sim$9 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ that are consistent with values found in dwarf galaxies with extremely low metal content. All CO clouds are shifted ($\sim$60 pc) from the stellar population centers, and only one cloud appears within the densest \hi region. Two clouds have velocity offsets with the \hi of $\Delta v_{\rm los}\sim\!+13$ km s$^{-1}$ being within twice the velocity dispersion ($\Delta v_{\rm los}/\sigma_{\rm HI,los}\sim2$) and probably bound. However, the northern cloud is faster ($\Delta v_{\rm los}\sim\!+57$ km s$^{-1}$); our models with low halo masses ($M_{\rm h}\! \lesssim \!10^9$ M$_{\odot}$) result in unbound orbits, suggesting that this material is likely being expelled from the dwarf, providing evidence for molecular gas depletion. These properties reveal a perturbed dynamics intertwined with star formation processes in low-mass dwarf galaxies, supporting a scenario of episodic bursts until they are fully quenched by the MW environment.

 - **Abstract**
 The Neutron Star X-ray binary Sco X-1 is one of the brightest Z-type sources in our Galaxy, showing frequent periods of flaring activity and different types of relativistic outflows. Observations with RXTE have shown that the strongest X-ray variability appears in the transition from/to the flaring state. During this transition, it has been proposed that two particular types of quasi-periodic oscillations might be connected with the ejection of the so-called ultra-relativistic flows. In this paper, we present an analysis of the first NICER observations of Sco X-1 obtained during a multi-wavelenght campaign conducted in February 2019, in order to characterise the properties of QPOs as the system evolves through its various accretion states. We compute a light-curve and a Hardness-Intensity diagram to track the evolution of the source spectral properties, while we investigate the X-ray time variability with a Dynamical Power Density Spectrum. To trace the temporal evolution of QPOs, we segment the dataset into shorter, continuous intervals, and compute and fit the averaged PDS for each interval. Our analysis shows that the overall behaviour of the source is consistent with the literature; strong QPOs around 6 Hz are detected on the normal branch, while transitions to/from the flaring branch -- occurring over timescales of a few hundreds of seconds -- are characterised by rapid, weaker quasi-periodic variability reaching frequencies up to 15 Hz. Despite limited statistical significance, we also identify faint, transient timing features above 20 Hz, occasionally coexisting with the prominent 6 Hz QPOs. Although tentative, the existence of these features in the NICER data is crucial for interpreting the simultaneous radio observations from the same multi-wavelength campaign, potentially reinforcing the connection between the ejection of relativistic outflows and the accretion states in Sco X-1.

 - **Abstract**
 The Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization 21 cm Signal (EDGES) has reported evidence for an absorption feature in the sky-averaged radio background near 78 MHz. A cosmological interpretation of this signal corresponds to absorption of 21 cm photons by neutral hydrogen at $z \sim 17$. The large depth of the signal has been shown to require an excess radio background above the CMB and/or non-standard cooling processes in the IGM. Here, we explore the plausibility of a scenario in which the EDGES signal is back-lit by an excess radio background sourced from a population of radio-loud AGN at high redshift. These AGN could also explain the unexpected abundance of UV-bright objects observed at $z > 10$ by JWST. We find that producing enough radio photons to explain the EDGES depth requires that nearly all high-$z$ UV-bright objects down to $M_{\mathrm{UV}} \gtrsim -15$ are radio-loud AGN and that the UV density of such objects declines by at most 1.5 orders of magnitude between $z = $10 and 20. In addition, the fraction of X-ray photons escaping these objects must be $\lesssim 1\%$ of their expected intrinsic production rate to prevent the absorption signal being washed out by early IGM pre-heating. Reproducing the sharp boundaries of the absorption trough and its flat bottom requires that the UV luminosity function, the fraction of UV light produced by AGN, and the X-ray escape fraction have fine-tuned redshift dependence. We conclude that radio-loud AGN are an unlikely (although physically possible) candidate to explain EDGES because of the extreme physical properties required for them to do so.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advancements in high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) have significantly improved our understanding of jet collimation near supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), particularly in high-power systems. However, the collimation properties of jets in low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) remain poorly explored. In this study, we investigate the jet structure of M84, a nearby radio galaxy and a representative LLAGN, to probe jet collimation properties in a low-accretion regime. Utilizing astrometric phase-referencing observations from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), supplemented by archival Very Large Array (VLA) data, we trace the jet geometry of M84 over a broad range of scales, from approximately 10^2 to 10^7 Schwarzschild radii (rs). Our analysis reveals a well-defined transition from a semi-parabolic profile, W(r) proportional to r^0.71, to a conical shape, W(r) proportional to r^1.16, occurring at approximately 1.67 x 10^4 rs. This indicates that the M84 jet is notably less collimated than those in other known LLAGN sources. Our findings provide new insights into the relationship between jet collimation and accretion rate, offering crucial constraints for jet formation models in LLAGNs.
#### Quenching Through Tidal Gas Removal: Molecular Gas and Star Formation in Tidal Tails of z ~ 0.7 Post-Starburst Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The active suppression of star formation in galaxies is critical in preventing the growth of overly massive systems and explaining the formation of present-day elliptical galaxies. We present a high-resolution, spatially-resolved multiwavelength study of two z ~ 0.7 massive post-starburst galaxies, SDSS J1448+1010 and SDSS J2258+2313, from the SQuIGGLE survey (Studying Quenching in Intermediate-z Galaxies: Gas, anguLar momentum, and Evolution), providing new insights into the role of mergers in driving quenching. ALMA CO(2-1) observations show that both galaxies removed ~50% of their molecular gas into extended tidal tails, spanning up to 65 kpc, following recent mergers. HST WFC3 imaging and grism spectroscopy show that while SDSS J1448+1010 exhibits Halpha emission in its northern tidal tail consistent with ongoing star formation, SDSS J2258+2313 lacks detectable star-forming activity outside the central galaxy. VLA 6 GHz continuum data reveal compact radio emission in SDSS J2258+2313, while SDSS J1448+1010 hosts small radio jets indicative of AGN activity. Both galaxies retain substantial molecular gas reservoirs in their central regions that appear more turbulent than 'normal' star-forming galaxies, likely contributing to the observed low star formation rates in the hosts. Despite similarities in their cold gas content and tidal features the galaxies are distinct from each other in their star formation, gas-star alignment, and radio morphology, highlighting the complexity of tidal gas removal as a quenching mechanism at intermediate redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new observations that densely sample the microwave (4-360 GHz) continuum spectra from eight young systems in the Taurus region. Multi-component, empirical model prescriptions were used to disentangle the contributions from their dust disks and other emission mechanisms. We found partially optically thick, free-free emission in all these systems, with positive spectral indices (median $\alpha_{\rm c} \approx 1$ at 10 GHz) and contributing 5-50% of the 43 GHz fluxes. There is no evidence for synchrotron or spinning dust grain emission contributions for these targets. The inferred dust disk spectra all show substantial curvature: their spectral indices decrease with frequency, from $\alpha_{\rm d} \approx 2.8$-4.0 around 43 GHz to 1.7-2.1 around 340 GHz. This curvature suggests that a substantial fraction of the (sub)millimeter ($\gtrsim$ 200 GHz) dust emission may be optically thick, and therefore the traditional metrics for estimating dust masses are flawed. Assuming the emission at lower frequencies (43 GHz) is optically thin, the local spectral indices and fluxes were used to constrain the disk-averaged dust properties and estimate corresponding dust masses. These masses are roughly an order of magnitude higher ($\approx 1000 \, M_\oplus$) than those found from the traditional approach based on (sub)millimeter fluxes. These findings emphasize the value of broad spectral coverage - particularly extending to lower frequencies ($\sim$cm-band) - for accurately interpreting dust disk emission; such observations may help reshape our perspective on the available mass budgets for planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Planned and ongoing campaigns for the acquisition of high-quality local measurements of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) at interstellar cloud locations have generated intense interest in the use of such measurements to accurately backtrack Ultra High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) through the Milky Way, a crucial aspect of charged-particle astronomy. However, the inherent sparsity of these measurements raises concerns regarding the feasibility of this approach. We assessed the achievable accuracy of UHECR backtracking using mock sparse local GMF data derived from the Jansson & Farrar 2012 (JF12) GMF model and mock UHECR events. We created mock UHECR datasets that trace back within a 3 degree angular range from the galaxy M82 (a hypothesized UHECR source), and we investigated the impact on such backtracking attempts of varying GMF measurement sparsity and of varying GMF strength, which we emulated by rescaling the strength of the ordered components of the JF12 model. We found that: (a) for an average GMF strength of $1\mu G$, satisfactory backtracking results for magnetic rigidities of $10^{20}$ eV can be obtained even with very sparse measurements ($ \sim 1600$ pc); (b) when the average GMF strength is significantly increased ($\sim$ factor of 10) the accuracy of backtracking breaks down at measurement spacings of 400 pc. These findings emphasize on one hand that sparsity is not an automatic deal-breaker for the utility of local GMF measurements in UHECR backtracking. On the other hand, we also confirm that important challenges remain on the path from sparse local GMF measurements to precise charge-particle astronomy, especially in directions of high-strength ordered magnetic fields. This underscores the importance of using all available complementary magnetic field measurements and sophisticated reconstruction techniques to enable accurate backtracking of UHECR.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the bolometric evolution of the exceptional Type Ic Supernova (SN) 2022jli, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for its distinctive double-peaked light curve morphology, extended timescales, and the rapid, steep decline in luminosity observed at around 270 days after the SN discovery. We present a quantitative assessment of two leading models through hydrodynamic radiative simulations: two shells enriched with nickel and a combination of nickel and magnetar power. We explore the parameter space of a model in which the SN is powered by radioactive decay assuming a bimodal nickel distribution. While this setup can reproduce the early light curve properties, it faces problems to explain the prominent second peak. We therefore consider a hybrid scenario with a rapidly rotating magnetar as additional energy source. We find that the observed light curve morphology can be well reproduced by a model combining a magnetar engine and a double-layer $^{56}$Ni distribution. The best-fitting case consist of a magnetar with a spin period of $P\simeq 22$ ms and a bipolar magnetic field strength of $B\simeq 5\times 10^{14}$ G and a radioactive content with total nickel mass of 0.15 M$_\odot$, distributed across two distinct shells within a pre-SN structure of 11 M$_\odot$. To reproduce the abrupt drop in luminosity at $\sim 270$ d, the energy deposition from the magnetar must be rapidly and effectively switched off.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of activity emanating from (18916) 2000 OG44 (alternately designated 1977 SD), a minor planet previously reported to be both an extinct comet or an asteroid on a cometary orbit. We observed 2000 OG44 with a thin tail oriented towards the coincident anti-solar and anti-motion vectors (as projected on the sky) in images we acquired on UT 2023 July 24 and 26 with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5-meter Astrophysical Research Consortium telescope (New Mexico, USA). We also include observations made in Arizona with the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope at the Mount Graham International Observatory and the Lowell Observatory Lowell Discovery Telescope near Happy Jack. We performed dynamical simulations that reveal 2000 OG44 most likely originated in the Oort cloud, arriving within the last 4 Myr. We find 2000 OG44, which crosses the orbits of both Jupiter and Mars, is at present on an orbit consistent with a Jupiter-family comet (JFC). We carried out thermodynamical modeling that informed our broader diagnosis that the observed activity is most likely due to volatile sublimation.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we develop a modeling framework based on spatio-temporal generalized random fields to simulate the time-evolving accretion flows and their associated imaging signatures around rotating regular black holes. We extend the Matérn field formalism to the spatio-temporal domain and introduce a locally anisotropic tensor structure \(\Lambda(\mathbf{x})\), which encodes direction-dependent correlation scales motivated by Keplerian velocity fields, thereby generating physically informed perturbation structures. Coupled with a computationally efficient light ray-tracing scheme, this framework produces a sequence of time-resolved images of regular black hole shadow and accretion structures. By incorporating light-travel time effects, we identify significant temporal smearing of features within strongly lensed regions and rapidly varying sources, thus enhancing the physical realism of the modeling. Comparison with existing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations demonstrates that our stochastic generative model maintains statistical consistency while offering substantial computational efficiency. Moreover, the simulated results reproduce the dynamic positional shift of the bright ring structure observed in M87$^{*}$, providing theoretical support for interpreting its time-variable images.

 We present and discuss optical emission line properties obtained from the analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra for an X-ray selected sample of 3684 galaxies (0.002 < z < 0.55), drawn from the eRASS1 catalog. We modeled SDSS-V DR19 spectra using the NBursts full spectrum fitting technique with E-MILES simple stellar populations (SSP) models and emission line templates to decompose broad and narrow emission line components for correlation with X-ray properties. We place the galaxies on the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram to diagnose their dominant excitation mechanism. We show that the consistent use of the narrow component fluxes shifts most galaxies systematically and significantly upward to the active galactic nuclei (AGN) region on the BPT diagram. On this basis, we confirm the dependence between a galaxys position on the BPT diagram and its (0.2-2.3 keV) X-ray/H$\alpha$ flux ratio. We also verified the correlation between X-ray luminosity and emission line luminosities of the narrow [O\iii]$\lambda 5007$ and broad H$\alpha$ component; as well as the relations between the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) mass, the X-ray luminosity, and the velocity dispersion of the stellar component ($\sigma_{*}$) on the base on the unique sample of optical spectroscopic follow-up of X-ray sources detected by eROSITA. These results highlight the importance of emission line decomposition in AGN classification and refine the connection between X-ray emission and optical emission line properties in galaxies.
#### From Equipartition to Curvature: The Spectral Evolution of 4FGL Blazars

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of spectral energy distribution (SED) and underlying electron energy distribution (EED) by modeling the nearly simultaneous broadband spectra of selected bright 4FGL blazars, in the context of a combined cooling and stochastic acceleration scenario. We find that one-zone leptonic model with log-parabolic (LP) EED can successfully fit the GeV-TeV emission of blazars. The synchrotron frequency $\nu_s$ of blazars mainly evolves due to variation of electron peak energy $\gamma_{3p}$. The BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) show a negative trend in the $\nu_s- \nu_s L_s$ SED plane, known as blazar sequence, that does not seem to be an artifact of Doppler boosting, but driven by the equipartition constraints. A positive correlation is found between the derived magnetic field $B$ and electron density $n_e$, whereas $n_e$ and $\gamma_{3p}$ negatively relate, as expected in an equipartition scenario. The flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) deviate significantly from such a scenario, indicating their jet parameters should be varying independently. The synchrotron peak frequency $\nu_s$ and its spectral curvature $b_s$ negatively correlate for all blazars, confirming the stochastic particle acceleration in blazar jets. However, blazars do not show the signature of hard-sphere acceleration, indicating that magnetic turbulence in the jets might be soft and physical conditions might be near to steady state, consistent with equipartition. Furthermore, for BL Lacs, the SED curvature $b_s$ and the EED curvature $r$ and nearly meet the theoretical relationship $r=5b_s$, whereas the FSRQs show large deviation due to poor constrain on $b_s$ due to presence of thermal component.
#### Continuum Reverberation Mapping of Accretion Disks Surrounding Supermassive Black Hole Binaries: Observational Signatures

 - **Abstract**
 It has remained challenging to reliably identify sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), despite them being expected to be ubiquitous. We propose a new method using multi-band continuum reverberation mapping to identify low-mass-ratio SMBHBs in active galactic nuclei. The basic principle is that, due to the presence of a low-density cavity between the mini-disks and the circumbinary disk, the continuum emissions show a deficit at certain wavelengths, leading to a distinguishing feature in the relation between the inter-band time lag and wavelengths $\tau(\lambda)$. Specifically, the relation appears flat at short wavelengths because of the truncated sizes of the mini-disks and transits to a power law $\lambda^{4/3}$ at long wavelength stemming from the circumbinary disk. This transition feature is distinct from the uniform relation $\lambda^{4/3}$ of the standard accretion disk around a single black hole. Using the lamp-post scenario and assuming that only the secondary black hole is active in a low-mass-ratio SMBHB, we design a simple continuum reverberation model to calculate the transfer function of the accretion disks and the resulting $\tau(\lambda)$ relations for various SMBHB orbital parameters. The transition wavelength typically can lie at UV/optical bands, mainly depending on the total mass and orbital separation of the SMBHB. We apply our SMBHB model to the intensive multiwavelength monitoring data of the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and find that the SMBHB model can reproduce the inter-band time lags. Remarkably, the inferred total mass and orbital period from the SMBHB fitting are consistent with values derived from other independent methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) was the brightest comet in the northern hemisphere since C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp), providing a unique opportunity to study its composition and spatial distribution of emissions. We conducted narrow-band photometry and long-slit low-resolution spectroscopy to monitor the comet's activity and compositional evolution over several weeks post-perihelion. Narrow-band images (OH, NH, CN, C$_2$, C$_3$, BC, GC, RC) and broad-band images (B, V, Rc, Ic) were acquired with TRAPPIST-North between 22 July and 10 September 2020 to derive production rates, mixing ratios, and dust proxy (Af$\rho$). A long-slit spectrum obtained on 24 July 2020 with HFOSC on the 2-m HCT was used to analyse emission profiles along the sunward and anti-sunward directions. We report production rates and mixing ratios of OH, NH, CN, C$_2$, C$_3$, and NH$_2$, and derive the water production rate using forbidden oxygen line flux. Ionic emissions from N$_2^+$, CO$^+$, CO$_2^+$, and H$_2$O$^+$ were detected at 4$\times$10$^4$ to 1$\times$10$^5$ km from the nucleus in the tailward direction. The average N$_2^+$/CO$^+$ ratio was found to be (3.0 $\pm$ 1.0)$\times$10$^{-2}$, refined to (4.8 $\pm$ 2.4)$\times$10$^{-2}$ using fluorescence modeling. The CO$_2^+$/CO$^+$ ratio was measured to be 1.34 $\pm$ 0.21. These results suggest the comet likely formed in the cold mid-to-outer solar nebula (approx. 50-70 K). Additionally, the average rotation period was estimated as 7.28 $\pm$ 0.79 hours, with a CN outflow velocity of 2.40 $\pm$ 0.25 km/s

Recent X-ray polarimetry results with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer have revealed it as a concealed ultraluminous X-ray source. It is also the first source where pronounced orbital variability of X-ray polarization has been detected -- notably with only one polarization maximum per orbit. Polarization caused by scattering of the source X-rays can only be orbitally variable if the scattering angles change throughout the orbit. Since this requires an asymmetrically distributed medium around the compact object, the observed variability traces the intrabinary structures. The single-peaked profile further imposes constraints on the possible geometry of the surrounding medium. Therefore, the X-ray polarization of Cygnus X-3 is the first opportunity to study the wind structures of high-mass X-ray binaries in detail. We aim to uncover the underlying geometry through analytical modeling of the polarized variability. Knowledge of these structures could be extended to other sources with similar wind-binary interactions. We study the variability caused by single scattering in the intrabinary bow shock, exploring both the optically thin and optically thick limits. We consider two geometries of the reflecting medium, the axisymmetric parabolic bow shock and the parabolic cylinder shock, and determine the geometry that best matches the X-ray polarimetric data. We find that the peculiar properties of the data can only be replicated with a cylindrical bow shock with asymmetry across the shock centerline and significant optical depth. This geometry is comparable to shocks formed by the jet-wind or outflow-wind interactions. The position angle of the orbital axis is slightly misaligned from the orientation of the radio jet in all our model fits.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first observations of magnetic fields in pre-planetary nebulae (PPNe) made with the POL-2 polarimeter on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). We observed the PPNe CRL 618 and OH231.8+4.2 in 850 $\mu$m polarized light. In both cases, we observe ordered magnetic fields that appear to arise from dusty circumstellar material that has been swept up by the passage of outflows driven by the central post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) star. CRL 618 shows a magnetic field aligned with one of the most extreme position angles of the outflowing bullets ejected from the central source. We hypothesize that polarized emission in CRL 618 may preferentially arise from material in the walls of the dust cavity opened by the ejected bullets. Conversely, OH231.8+4.2 shows a magnetic field that is aligned approximately perpendicular to the outflow direction, which may preferentially arise from an infrared-bright dense clump embedded near the base of the outflow. Despite CRL 618 being carbon-rich and OH231.8+4.2 being oxygen-rich, there is no significant difference in the polarization fractions of the two sources. This suggests that at linear resolutions $\sim 10^{4}$ au, the complexity of the magnetic field geometry on scales smaller than the beam, rather than grain composition, sets the measured polarization fraction of these sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence and magnetic fields are components of the interstellar medium and are interconnected through plasma processes. In particular, the magnetic flux transport in the presence of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is an essential factor for understanding star formation. The theory of Reconnection Diffusion (RD), based on statistics of Alfvénic turbulence, predicts a dependence of the diffusion coefficient of the magnetic field on the Alfvénic Mach number $M_A$. However, this theory does not consider the effects of compressibility which are important in the regime of supersonic MHD turbulence. In this work, we measure the diffusion coefficient of magnetic fields in sub-Alfvénic MHD turbulence, with different sonic Mach numbers $M_S$. We perform numerical simulations of forced turbulence in periodic domains from the incompressible limit to the supersonic regime. We introduce two methods to extract the diffusion coefficient, based on the analysis of tracer particles. Our results confirm the RD assumption regarding the correspondence between the diffusion of magnetic field and that of fluid Lagrangian particles. The measured diffusion rate provided by incompressible turbulence agrees with the suppression predicted by the RD theory in the presence of strong magnetic fields: $D \propto M_A^3$. Our simulations also indicate an increase in RD efficiency when the turbulence is compressible. The dependency on $M_A$ and $M_S$ from the simulations can be described by the relation $D \propto M_A^\alpha$, where $\alpha(M_S) \approx 3/(1 + M_S)$. This quantitative characterization of $D$ is critical for modeling star formation in turbulent molecular clouds and evaluating the efficiency of this transport compared to other mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Outflows and jets launched from the nuclei of galaxies emit radio synchrotron emission that can be used to study the impact of accretion energy on the host galaxy. The decades-long baseline now enabled by large radio surveys allows us to identify cases where new outflows or jets have been launched. Here, we present the results of a targeted VLA program observing four post-starburst galaxies that have brightened significantly in radio emission over the past ~20 years. We obtain quasi-simultaneous observations in five bands (1-18 GHz) for each source. We find peaked spectral energy distributions, indicative of self-absorbed synchrotron emission. While all four sources have risen significantly over the past ~20 years in the 1-2 GHz band, two also show clear recent flares in the 2-4 GHz band. These sources are less luminous than typical peaked spectrum radio AGN. It remains unclear whether these sources are low luminosity analogs of the peaked radio AGN from accreted gas, or driven by tidal disruption events with missed optical flares. Regardless of the source of the accreted material, these newly-launched outflows contain sufficient energy to drive the molecular gas outflows observed in post-starburst galaxies and to drive turbulence suppressing star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest is a key tracer of large-scale structure at redshifts z > 2, traditionally studied using spectra of quasars. Here, we explore the viability Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) as alternative background sources for Ly$\alpha$ forest studies. We analyze 4,151 Ly$\alpha$ forest skewers extracted from LBG spectra obtained in the DESI pilot surveys in the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields. We present the first measurement of the Ly$\alpha$ forest auto-correlation function derived exclusively from LBG spectra, probing comoving separations up to 48 $h^{-1}$Mpc at an effective redshift of $z_\mathrm{eff}$ = 2.70. The measured signal is consistent with that from DESI DR2 quasar Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra at a comparable redshift, validating LBGs as reliable background sources. We also measure the cross-correlation between the LBG Ly$\alpha$ forest and 13,362 galaxy positions, showing that this observable serves as a sensitive diagnostic for galaxy redshift uncertainties and systematic offsets. Finally, using synthetic LBG spectra and Fisher forecasts, we show that a future wide-area survey over 5000 deg$^2$, targeting 1000 LBGs per deg$^2$ at similar signal-to-noise than our dataset, could enable Ly$\alpha$ forest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements with 0.4% precision on the isotropic BAO scale and 1.3% on the anisotropic (Alcock-Paczynski) scale. Combining BAO with a Ly$\alpha$ forest full-shape analysis improves the AP constraint to 0.6%. These results open a new path for precision cosmology at high redshift using dense LBG samples.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar active regions are where sunspots are located and photospheric magnetic fluxes are concentrated, therefore being the sources of energetic eruptions in the solar atmosphere. The detection and statistics of solar active regions have been forefront topics in solar physics. In this study, we developed a solar active region detector (SARD) based on the advanced object detection model YOLOv8. First, we applied image processing techniques including thresholding and morphological operations to 6975 line-of-sight magnetograms from 2010 to 2019 at a cadence of 12~h, obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory. With manual refinement, we labeled 26531 active regions in the dataset for further training and test with the detection model. Without any overlap between the training and test sets, the superior performance of SARD is demonstrated by an average precision rate as high as 94\%. We then performed a statistical analysis on the area and magnetic flux of the detected active regions, both of which yield log-normal distributions. This result sheds light on the underlying complexity and multi-scale nature of solar active regions.
#### Gamma rays as leptonic portals to energetic neutrinos: a new Monte Carlo approach

 - **Abstract**
 High center-of-mass electromagnetic~(EM) interactions could produce decaying heavy leptons and hadrons, leading to neutrino generation. These processes might occur in the most extreme astrophysical scenarios, potentially altering the expected gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes in both the hadronic and the leptonic pictures. For instance, neutrinos could arise from high-redshift EM cascades, triggered by gamma rays beyond $10^{18} \; \text{eV}$ scattering background photons, from radio to ultraviolet energy bands. Such energetic gamma rays are predicted in cosmogenic models and in scenarios involving non-standard physics. On astrophysical scales, leptonic production of neutrinos could take place in active galactic nuclei cores, where several-TeV gamma rays interact with the X-ray photons from the hot corona. We explore these scenarios within the CRPropa Monte Carlo code framework, developing dedicated tools to account for leptonic production and decay of heavy leptons and hadrons. In particular, the latter are performed by interfacing with the PYTHIA event generator. With these novel tools, we characterise the spectrum and flavour composition of neutrinos emerging from cosmological EM cascades and from leptonic processes in the core of active galactic nuclei. Finally, we investigate the leptonic production of neutrinos in the context of the IceCube detection of NGC~1068.

 - **Abstract**
 3I/ATLAS is the third macroscopic interstellar object detected traversing the Solar System. Since its initial discovery on UT 01 July 2025, hundreds of hours on a range of observational facilities have been dedicated to measure the physical properties of this object. These observations have provided astrometry to refine the orbital solution, photometry to measure the color, a rotation period and secular light curve, and spectroscopy to characterize the composition of the coma. Here, we report precovery photometry of 3I/ATLAS as observed with NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). 3I/ATLAS was observed nearly continuously by TESS from UT 07 May 2025 to 02 June 2025. We use the shift-stack method to create deep stack images to recover the object. These composite images reveal that 3I/ATLAS has an average TESS magnitude of $T_\textrm{mag} = 19.6 \pm 0.1$ and an absolute visual magnitude of $H_V = 12.5 \pm 0.3$, consistent with magnitudes reported in July 2025, suggesting that 3I/ATLAS may have been active out at $\sim 6.4$ au. Additionally, we extract a $\sim 20$ day light curve and find no statistically significant evidence of a nucleus rotation period. Nevertheless, the data presented here are some of the earliest precovery images of 3I/ATLAS and may be used in conjunction with future observations to constrain the properties of our third interstellar interloper.

 - **Abstract**
 PDS 70c is a source of Ha emission and variable sub-mm signal. Understanding its emission mechanisms may enable observations of accretion rates and physical conditions in the circum-planetary environment. We report ALMA observations of PDS 70 at 145 GHz (Band 4), 343.5 GHz (Band 7) and 671 GHz (Band 9) and compare with data at 97.5 GHz (Band 3), taken within two months. The radio spectrum (SED) is analyzed with analytic circumplanetary disk (CPD). In a novel approach we include the free-free continuum from HI, metals (e.g. KI) and H-. New detections in Bands 3 (tentative at 2.6sigma), 4 (5sigma), and 7 (re-detected at 9sigma) are consistent with optically thick thermal emission from PDS 70c (spectral index alpha 2+-0.2). However, a Band 9 non-detection lies 2.6sigma below an optically thick extrapolation. A viscous dusty disk is inconsistent with the data, even with the inclusion of ionised jets. Interestingly, the central temperatures in such CPD models are high enough to ionise HI, with huge emission measures and an optically thick spectrum that marginally accounts for the SED (within 3sigma of Band 9). By contrast, uniform-slab models suggest much lower emission measures to account for the Band 9 drop, with ionisation fractions ~1E-7 , and an outer radius of ~0.1au. Such conditions are recovered if the CPD interacts with a planetary magnetic field, leading to a radially variable viscosity alpha(R)<~1 and central temperatures ~1E3K that regulate metal ionisation. However, the H- opacity still results in an optically thick SED, overshooting Band 9. We find that the optically thin turnover at ~600GHz is only recovered if a thin shocked layer is present at the CPD surface, as suggested by simulations. A photospheric shock or accretion funnels are ruled out as radio emission sources because their small solid angles require T~1e6K, which are unrealistic planetary shock accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasar microlensing can be used to constrain important astrophysical properties, such as the accretion disk size and the amount of stars in the lensing galaxy. The associated brightness variations over time, in particular high magnification events (HMEs) and caustic crossings, can yield precise constraints due to their strong dependence on the relative projected velocities of the components and accretion disk size. The next generation of large sky area surveys, such as The Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST) and Euclid, are expected to find and follow-up thousands of lensed quasars from which such events could be identified and observed. In this work we present a characterization and estimation of all HMEs that could potentially be observed, focusing on systems that could be identified by ground based telescopes. From systems whose minimum image separation is at least 1 arcsec, and their second dimmest image is at least 21.5 magnitudes in the i-band ($\sim560$ in the southern or northern sky), we estimate $\sim60$ HMEs with amplitudes $>0.3$ [mag] in the r-band per year. We find that on average, saddle images are approximately four times more likely to host events than minima, and $\sim10\%$ ($\sim50\%$) of events are caustic crossings for saddles (minima). We also find that HMEs in saddle images can have amplitudes $\sim1-2$ [mag] larger than minima.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion disks in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are predicted to become gravitationally unstable substantially interior to the black hole's sphere of influence, at radii where the disk is simultaneously unstable to the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Using local shearing box simulations with net vertical flux and a simple cooling prescription, we investigate the effect of magnetic fields on fragmentation in the limit of ideal magnetohydrodyamics. Different levels of in-disk magnetic field from the magnetorotational instability are generated by varying the initial vertical-field plasma beta $\beta_0$. We find that the disk becomes magnetically dominated when $\beta_0 < 10^3$, and that this transition is accompanied by a drastic drop in fragmentation (as measured by the bound mass fraction) and gravitational stress. The destabilizing influence of radial magnetic fields, which are present locally and which may promote fragmentation via magnetic tension effects, is overwhelmed by magnetic elevation, which significantly reduces the mid-plane density. The magnetic suppression of fragmentation in magnetically elevated disks has implications for the radial extent of the accretion flow in AGN disks, and for the efficiency of in situ formation of disk-embedded stars that are progenitors for single and binary compact objects.

 - **Abstract**
 The age determination of symbiotic stars is essential to put further constraints on models explaining these binary systems. In the Galactic field, this is especially problematic because of several limitations due to reddening estimations, for example. We searched for symbiotic stars as members of Galactic open clusters for which the age and overall metallicity can be determined in a statistical sense. The most recent lists of well-established and candidate symbiotic stars and open clusters were matched, and we found seven good candidates from which the well-established symbiotic star CQ Dra seems to be a true member of the old open cluster HSC 1224. The colour-magnitude diagrams for the other candidates raise some doubts about membership.

 - **Abstract**
 Axion-like particles (ALPs) provide a compelling avenue for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. In astrophysical magnetized plasmas an ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ induces energy-dependent oscillations in the photon survival probability that imprint modulations on emission spectra. X-ray observations of bright spectrally-smooth sources can provide particularly sensitive probes of ultralight ALPs with masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV due to long propagation distances, strong magnetic fields and high photon statistics. We present a comprehensive forecast of ALP-photon conversion in three representative systems: (i) background active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed through foreground intracluster magnetic fields, (ii) central AGNs within their host cluster halos and (iii) Galactic X-ray binaries viewed through the Milky Way field. Using detailed simulations we assess the prospective sensitivity of high-resolution X-ray missions including XRISM, Athena, and Arcus. For typical magnetic field configurations a 5 Ms XRISM observation of the Perseus Cluster AGN NGC 1275 can reach down to $g_{a\gamma} \sim 3 \times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $m_a \lesssim 10^{-12}$ eV, while Athena's superior energy resolution improves this reach by a factor of $\sim 3$. We quantify the impact of magnetic field modeling, photon statistics, and spectral binning strategies. Our results demonstrate the scientific potential of high-resolution X-ray observations to probe photon-ALP coupling in previously inaccessible parameter space, offering a powerful window into physics beyond the Standard Model.
#### Little Red Dots as self-gravitating discs accreting on supermassive stars: Spectral appearance and formation pathway of the progenitors to direct collapse black holes

 - **Abstract**
 We propose an alternative physical interpretation and formation pathway for the recently discovered "little red dots" (LRDs). We model LRDs as super-massive stars (SMSs) surrounded by massive self-gravitating accretion discs (SMDs) that form as a consequence of gas-rich major galaxy mergers. The model provides an excellent match for numerous spectral features of LRDs, where the V-shape arises from the superposition of two black bodies, and Balmer line broadening is sourced by the intrinsic rotation of the SMD. No additional AGN, stellar wind, dust obscuration or galactic component is required. This results in a model with uniquely few, physically motivated free parameters that are robust to variations in observed LRD properties. We perform MCMC fits for two representative LRD spectra, for which the full parameter posterior distributions are determined. Allowing for a compressed SMS mass-radius relation, the recovered parameters are compatible with sub-Eddington accretion in self-gravitating discs, and the recovered SMS masses of few $ 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$ imply the subsequent formation of massive black holes (BH) that squarely follow the expected BH mass--galaxy mass relation. In addition, the model implies a redshift distribution for LRDs that accurately matches with observations.
