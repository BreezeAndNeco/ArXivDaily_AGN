 - **Abstract**
 Runaway stars are characterized by higher space velocities than typical field stars. They are presumed to have been ejected from their birth places by one or more energetic mechanisms, including supernova explosions. Accurate radial velocities are essential for investigating their origin, by tracing back their Galactic orbits to look for close encounters in space and in time with neutron stars and young associations. While most studies of runaways have focused on OB stars, later-type stars have also been considered on occasion. Here we report the results of a long-term high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring program with the goal of providing accurate radial velocities for 188 runaway candidates of spectral type A and later, proposed by Tetzlaff et al. (2011). We obtained multiple measurements over a period of about 13 yr to guard against the possibility that some may be members of binary or multiple systems, adding archival observations going back another 25 yr in some cases. We report new spectroscopic orbital solutions for more than three dozen systems. Many more are also found to be binaries based on available astrometric information. A small-scale study carried out here to trace back the paths of our targets together with those of four well-studied, optically-visible neutron stars among the so-called Magnificent Seven, resulted in no credible encounters.

 - **Abstract**
 As the most massive nodes of the cosmic web, galaxy clusters represent the best probes of structure formation. Over time, they grow by accreting and disrupting satellite galaxies, adding those stars to the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the intra-cluster light (ICL). However, the formation pathways of different galaxy clusters can vary significantly. To inform upcoming large surveys, we aim to identify observables that can distinguish galaxy cluster formation pathways. Using four different hydrodynamical simulations, Magneticum, TNG100 of IllustrisTNG, Horizon-AGN, and Hydrangea, we study how the fraction of stellar mass in the BCG and ICL ($f_{ICL+BCG}$) relates to the galaxy cluster mass assembly history. For all simulations, $f_{ICL+BCG}$ is the best tracer for the time at which the cluster has accumulated 50% of its mass ($z_{f}$), performing better than other typical dynamical tracers, such as the subhalo mass fraction, the halo mass, and the center shift. More relaxed clusters have higher $f_{ICL+BCG}$, in rare cases up to 90%, while dynamically active clusters have lower fractions, down to 20%, which we find to be independent of the exact implemented baryonic physics. We determine the average increase in $f_{ICL+BCG}$ from stripping and mergers to be between 3-4% per Gyr. $f_{ICL+BCG}$ is tightly traced by the stellar mass ratio between the BCG and both the second (M12) and fourth (M14) most massive cluster galaxy. The average galaxy cluster has assembled half of its halo mass by $z_{f}=0.67$ (about 6 Gyr ago), though individual histories vary significantly from $z_{f}=0.06$ to $z_{f}=1.77$ (0.8 to 10 Gyr ago). As all four cosmological simulations consistently find that $f_{ICL+BCG}$ is an excellent tracer of the cluster dynamical state, upcoming surveys can leverage measurements of $f_{ICL+BCG}$ to statistically quantify the assembly of the most massive structures.
#### Die Hard: The On-Off-Cycle of Galaxies on the Star Formation Main Sequence

 - **Abstract**
 Our picture of galaxy evolution currently assumes that galaxies spend their life on the star formation main sequence until they may eventually be quenched. However, recent observations show indications that the full picture might be more complicated. We reveal how the star formation rates of galaxies evolve, possible causes and imprints of different evolution scenarios on galactic features. We follow the evolution of central galaxies in the highest-resolution box of the Magneticum Pathfinder cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and classify their evolution scenarios with respect to the star formation main sequence. We find that a major fraction of the galaxies undergoes long-term cycles of quenching and rejuvenation on Gyr timescales. This expands the framework of galaxy evolution from a secular evolution to a sequence of multiple active and passive phases. Only 14% of field galaxies on the star formation main sequence at z~0 actually evolved along the scaling relation, while the bulk of star forming galaxies in the local universe have undergone cycles of quenching and rejuvenation. In this work we describe the statistics of these galaxy evolution modes and how this impacts their stellar masses, ages and metallicities today. Galaxies with rejuvenation cycles can be distinguished well from main-sequence-evolved galaxies in their features at z~0. We further explore possible explanations and find that the geometry of gas accretion at the halo outskirts shows a strong correlation with the star formation rate evolution, while the density parameter as a tracer of environment shows no significant correlation. A derivation of star formation rates from gas accretion with simple assumptions only works reasonably well in the high-redshift universe where accreted gas gets quickly converted into stars.
#### Bar ages derived for the first time in nearby galaxies: Insights on secular evolution from the TIMER sample

 - **Abstract**
 Once galaxies settle their discs and become self-gravitating, stellar bars can form, driving the subsequent evolution of their host galaxy. Determining the ages of bars can therefore shed light on the epoch of the onset of secular evolution. In this work, we apply the first broadly applicable methodology to derive bar ages to a sample of 20 nearby galaxies. The method is based on the co-eval build-up of nuclear structures and bars and involves using IFS data from the MUSE instrument on VLT to disentangle the SFH of the nuclear disc from the background population. This allows us to derive the formation epoch of the nuclear disc and, thus, of the bar. We estimate the bar formation epoch of nearby galaxies - mostly from the TIMER survey-, creating the largest sample of galaxies with known bar ages to date. We find bar formation epochs between 1 and 13 Gyr ago, illustrating how disc-settling and bar formation are processes that first took place in the early Universe and are still taking place in some galaxies. We infer the bar fraction over cosmological time with our sample, finding remarkable agreement with that obtained from direct studies of galaxies at high redshifts. Additionally, for the first time, we can investigate secular evolution processes taking into account the ages of bars. Our results agree with the scenario in which bars aid the quenching of the host galaxy, with galaxies hosting older bars tending to be more "quenched". We also find that older bars tend to be longer, stronger, and host larger nuclear discs. Furthermore, we find evidence of the nuclear disc stellar mass build-up over time. On the other hand, we find no evidence of downsizing playing a role in bar formation, since we find that bar age is independent of galaxy stellar mass. With the means to estimate bar ages, we can begin to understand better when and how bars shape the observed properties of disc galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Cambridge Exoplanet Transit Recovery Algorithm (CETRA), a fast and sensitive transit detection algorithm, optimised for GPUs. CETRA separates the task into a search for transit signals across linear time space, followed by a phase-folding of the former to enable a periodic signal search, using a physically motivated transit model to improve detection sensitivity. It outperforms traditional methods like Box Least Squares and Transit Least Squares in both sensitivity and speed. Tests on synthetic light curves demonstrate that CETRA can identify at least 20 per cent more low-SNR transits than Transit Least Squares in the same data, particularly those of long period planets. It is also shown to be up to a few orders of magnitude faster for high cadence light curves, enabling rapid large-scale searches. Through application of CETRA to Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite short cadence data, we recover the three planets in the HD 101581 system with improved significance. In particular, the transit signal of the previously unvalidated planet TOI-6276.03 is enhanced from ${\rm SNR}=7.9$ to ${\rm SNR}=16.0$, which means it may now meet the criteria for statistical validation. CETRA's speed and sensitivity make it well-suited for current and future exoplanet surveys, particularly in the search for Earth analogues. Our implementation of this algorithm uses NVIDIA's CUDA platform and requires an NVIDIA GPU, it is open-source and available from GitHub and PyPI.
#### 3D Simulations Demonstrate Propagating Thermohaline Convection for Polluted White Dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Polluted white dwarfs (WDs) with small surface convection zones deposit significant concentrations of heavy elements to the underlying radiative interior, presumably driving thermohaline convection. Current models of polluted WDs frequently fail to account for this effect, although its inclusion can increase the inferred accretion rate by orders of magnitude. It has been argued that this instability cannot be treated as a continuous mixing process and thus should not be considered in these models. In this work, we study three-dimensional simulations of a thermohaline-unstable layer propagating into an underlying stable region, approximating the polluted WD scenario. We find that although thermohaline convection works to reduce driving gradients somewhat, the front continues to propagate and the system remains unstable. Importantly, the turbulent flux of metals broadly dominates over the diffusive flux in quantitative agreement with with existing mixing prescriptions implemented in some stellar evolution models (except slightly below the boundary of the propagating front, where recent prescriptions neglect overshoot-like effects). Thus, our results broadly support polluted WD models that include thermohaline mixing in their estimates of the settling rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Spatially resolved spectral studies of radio-AGN host galaxies have shown that these systems can impact the ionised gas on galactic scales. However, whether jet and radiation-driven feedback occurs simultaneously is still unclear. We select a large and representative sample of 806 radio-AGN from the MaNGA survey, from $L_\mathrm{1.4GHz}\approx10^{21}-10^{25}$W/Hz, and trace the warm ionised gas kinematics using the [OIII] emission line from the IFU spectra. We measure the [OIII] line width and compare it to the stellar velocity dispersion to determine the presence and location of the disturbed gas. We find most disturbed [OIII] kinematics and proportion of disturbed sources up to a radial distance of 0.25$R_{eff}$, when both radio and optical AGN are present in a source, and the radio luminosity is larger than $10^{23}$W/Hz. When either radio or optical-AGN are present, the impact on [OIII] is milder. Irrespective of the presence of an optical-AGN, we find significant differences in the feedback from high and low luminosity radio-AGN only up to a radial distance of 0.25$R_{eff}$. The presence of more kinematically disturbed warm ionised gas in the central region of radio-AGN host galaxies is related to both jets and radiation in these sources. We propose that in moderate radio luminosity AGN ($L_\mathrm{1.4GHz}\approx10^{23}-10^{25}$W/Hz) gas clouds pushed to high velocities by the jets (radiation) are driven to even higher velocities by the impact of radiation (jets) when both radio and optical-AGN are present. At lower luminosities ($L_\mathrm{1.4GHz}\approx10^{21}-10^{23}$W/Hz), the correlation between the disturbed ionised gas and enhanced radio emission could either be due to wind-driven shocks powering the radio emission, or low-power jets disturbing the gas.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray polarimetric observations from the Imaging X-ray Polarimeter Explorer (IXPE) is an excellent tool for probing the geometry and dynamics of X-ray emitting corona in active galactic nuclei (AGN). This work aims to investigate the geometry of the X-ray corona in the Seyfert 2 AGN, NGC 2110, using its first polarimetric observation with IXPE, conducted over a net exposure of 554 ks beginning on October 16, 2024. We performed a model-independent analysis of the 2-8 keV IXPE polarimetric observation to estimate the polarization properties of NGC 2110. Furthermore, we performed spectral and spectro-polarimetric analyses combining IXPE data with archival observations from NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Swift-XRT to derive detailed spectral and polarization properties. From the spectro-polarimetric analyses, an upper limit on the polarization degree (PD) of 7.6% (at the 99% confidence) was estimated in the 2-8 keV band. The spectro-polarimetric analysis in the 5.66-8 keV band yielded a looser upper limit of 27% at the 99 % confidence. Comparing the measured polarization properties, coronal parameters, and inclination angle of NGC 2110 with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MONK) simulations suggest that the current polarization measurements lack the sensitivity to place definitive constraints on the coronal geometry. The upper limits on PD, as derived from our analysis at the 99% confidence level, indicate that polarization remains undetected at a statistically significant level. Consequently, we are unable to determine whether the corona is elongated along the disk or more compact and spherical. Future observations with improved sensitivity will be crucial to breaking these degeneracies and providing deeper insight into the coronal structure of NGC 2110.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the formation and properties of relativistic jets from accreting compact objects has far-reaching implications in astrophysics. Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) - a class of neutron stars transitioning between radio pulsar and accretion states - offer a unique opportunity to study jet behavior within a low-level accretion regime around fast-spinning, magnetized neutron stars. We analyzed archival spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for both confirmed and candidate tMSPs from literature and various databases, aiming to identify jet spectra and determine physical conditions within these jets. For the tMSP candidate 4FGL J0427.8-6704, a high-inclination system that displays eclipses in optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray wavelengths, we derived a jet break frequency at $\nu_{\rm br} \approx 10^{11}$ Hz and determined properties of the jet base using a conical jet model (opening angle of $\phi < 32^\circ$, magnetic field strength of $B_{0}\sim100$ G, and radius of $R_{0}\sim10^{10}$ cm). Observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array reveal an average flux density of 0.4 mJy, with flares reaching up to 2 mJy on short (seconds) timescales. No eclipses were detected in the millimeter light curves, suggesting the jet base is farther from the central source than in other X-ray binaries ($z_{0}>7\times10^{10}$ cm). We also investigated SEDs of other confirmed and candidate tMSPs but did not find well-defined jet spectral breaks. However, a mid-infrared flux excess in tMSP XSS J12270-4859 suggests that the compact jet emission may extend into near-infrared or optical wavelengths. These results provide new insights into jet formation in tMSPs, highlighting the need for further multi-wavelength observations to fully characterize jet behavior in similar low-accretion systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Almost all the physics of star formation critically depends on the number density of the molecular gas. However, the methods to estimate this key property often rely on uncertain assumptions about geometry, depend on overly simplistic uniform models, or require time-expensive observations to constrain the gas temperature as well. An easy-to-use method to derive n(H2) that is valid under realistic conditions is absent, causing an asymmetry in how accurately this parameter is estimated, and how often dedicated tracers are used, compared to the gas temperature. We propose and calibrate a versatile tool based on CH3OH lines that greatly simplifies the inference of the number density. CH3OH is abundant in both cold and hot gas, and thus it can be applied to a wide variety of scales. Moreover, this tool does not need to be tailored to the specific source properties (e.g. distance, temperature, and mass). We perform RT calculations to investigate the robustness of the line ratios as density probes, also in the presence of density and temperature gradients. We find that the ratios of the (2_K-1_K) band transitions constrain the average n(H2) along the LOS within a factor of 2-3 in the range 5 x 10^4 - 3 x 10^7 cm^-3. The range can be extended down to a few times 10^3 cm^-3, when also using line ratios from the (5_K-4_K) and/or (7_K-6_K) bands. We provide practical analytic formulas and a numerical method for deriving n(H2) and its uncertainty from the line ratios. Thanks to our calibration and analytical recipes, we make the estimate of n(H2) much simpler, with an effort comparable or inferior to deriving Tex, contributing to offsetting the disparity between these two fundamental parameters of the molecular gas. Applying our method to a sub-sample of sources from the ATLASGAL TOP100 we show that the material in the clumps is being compressed, accelerating in the latest stages.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray binaries are systems composed of a compact object orbiting a massive companion star. The interaction between these two objects can drive relativistic outflows, either jets or winds, in which particles can be accelerated to energies reaching hundreds of tera-electronvolts (TeV). It is however still debated where and under which physical conditions particles are accelerated in these objects and ultimately whether protons can be accelerated up to PeV energies. Among the well-known gamma-ray binaries, LS 5039 is a high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) with an orbital period of 3.9 days that has been observed up to TeV energies by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). In this work, we present new observations of LS 5039 obtained with the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory. Our data reveal that the gamma-ray spectrum of LS 5039 extends up to 200 TeV with no apparent spectral cut-off. Furthermore, we confirm, with a confidence level of 4.7{\sigma}, that the emission between 2 TeV and 118 TeV is modulated by the orbital motion of the system, which indicates that these photons are likely produced within or near the binary orbit where they can undergo absorption by the stellar photons. In a leptonic scenario, the highest energy photons detected by HAWC can be emitted by ~200 TeV electrons inverse Compton scattering stellar photons, which would require an extremely efficient acceleration mechanism operating within LS 5039. Alternatively, a hadronic scenario could explain the data through proton-proton or proton-{\gamma} collisions of protons accelerated to peta-electronvolt (PeV) energies.

 - **Abstract**
 To mitigate the severe information loss arising from widely adopted linear scale cuts in constraints on modified gravity parameterisations with Weak Lensing (WL) and Large-Scale Structure (LSS) data, we introduce a novel alternative method for data reduction. This Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based framework extracts key features in the matter power spectrum arising from nonlinear effects in a set of representative gravity theories. By performing the analysis in the space of principal components, we can replace sweeping `linear-only' scale cuts with targeted cuts on the transformed data vector, ultimately reducing parameter bias and significantly tightening constraints. We forecast constraints on a minimal parameterised extension to $\Lambda$CDM which includes modifications to the growth of structure and lensing of light ($\Lambda$CDM$+\mu_0+\Sigma_0$) using mock Stage-IV data for two simulated cosmologies: the $\Lambda$CDM model and Extended Shift Symmetric (ESS) gravity. Under the assumption of a Universe defined by $\Lambda$CDM and General Relativity, our method offers constraints on $\mu_0$ a factor of 1.65 tighter than traditional linear-only scale cuts. Crucially, our approach also provides the necessary constraining power to break key degeneracies in modified gravity without relying on $f\sigma_8$ measurements, introducing a promising new tool for the analysis of present and future WL and LSS photometric surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting white dwarf binaries (AWDs) comprise cataclysmic variables (CVs), symbiotics, AM CVns, and other related systems that host a primary white dwarf (WD) accreting from a main sequence or evolved companion star. AWDs are a product of close binary evolution; thus, they are important for understanding the evolution and population of X-ray binaries in the Milky Way and other galaxies. AWDs are essential for studying astrophysical plasmas under different conditions along with accretion physics and processes, transient events, matter ejection and outflows, compact binary evolution, mergers, angular momentum loss mechanisms, and nuclear processes leading to explosions. AWDs are also closely related to other objects in the late stages of stellar evolution, with other accreting objects in compact binaries, and even share common phenomena with young stellar objects, active galactic nuclei, quasars, and supernova remnants. As X-ray astronomy came to a climax with the start of the Chandra and XMM-Newton missions owing to their unprecedented instrumentation, new excellent imaging capabilities, good time resolution, and X-ray grating technologies allowed immense advancement in many aspects of astronomy and astrophysics. In this review, we lay out a panorama of developments on the study of AWDs that have been accomplished and have been made possible by these two observatories; we summarize the key observational achievements and the challenges ahead.
#### INSPIRE: INvestigating Stellar Population In RElics VIII. Emission lines and UV colours in ultra-compact massive galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of emission lines in the optical spectra of ultra-compact massive galaxies (UCMGs) from INSPIRE, including relics, which are the oldest galaxies in the Universe. Emission-lines diagnostic diagrams suggest that all these UCMGs, independently of their star formation histories, are `retired galaxies'. They are inconsistent with being star-forming but lie in the same region of shock-driven emissions or photoionisation models, incorporating the contribution from post-asymptotic giant branch (pAGB) stars. Furthermore, all but one INSPIRE objects have a high [OII]/H{\alpha} ratio, resembling what has been reported for normal-size red and dead galaxies. The remaining object (J1142+0012) is the only one to show clear evidence for strong active galactic nucleus activity from its spectrum. We also provide near-UV (far-UV) fluxes for 20 (5) INSPIRE objects that match in GALEX. Their NUV-r colours are consistent with those of galaxies lying in the UV green valley, but also with the presence of recently (<0.5 Gyr) formed stars at the sub-percent fraction level. This central recent star formation could have been ignited by gas that was originally ejected during the pAGB phases and then re-compressed and brought to the core by the ram-pressure stripping of Planetary Nebula envelopes. Once in the centre, it can be shocked and re-emit spectral lines.

 We discuss what we call halo or galaxy root systems, collections of particle pathlines that show the infall of matter from the initial uniform distribution into a collapsed structure. The matter clumps as it falls in, producing filamentary density enhancements analogous to tree roots and branches, blood vessels, or even human transportation infrastructure in cities and regions. This relates to the larger-scale cosmic web, but is defined locally about one of its nodes; a physical, geometric version of a merger tree. We find dark-matter-halo root systems on average to exhibit more roots and root branches for the largest cluster haloes than in small haloes. This may relate to the `cosmic-web detachment' mechanism that likely contributes to star-formation quenching in galaxy groups and clusters. We also find that high spin manifests in these root systems as curvier roots.

 - **Abstract**
 Local-type primordial non-gaussianity generates a distinctive term in the clustering of tracers of large-scale structure, behaving as $k^{-2}$ at small wavenumbers $k$. In order to use this signal in a sample of galaxies to measure the amplitude of primordial non-gaussianity, $f_{NL}$, we need to independently determine the degenerate bias coefficient, $b_\Phi$, which quantifies the logarithmic response of the galaxy number density to a change in amplitude of the matter clustering. We study whether $b_\Phi$ may be estimated from the observed evolution of the number density of galaxies as a function of redshift. Using cosmological N-body simulations, we find that $b_\Phi$ may be estimated reasonably well for dark matter halos across the range of redshifts and halo masses used by large-scale structure surveys aimed at measuring $f_{NL}$. This includes non-gaussian secondary bias (or assembly bias) in halo concentration, which has previously been found to be quite large in amplitude. For an observed survey of galaxies, we additionally need to consider the selection function of the sample, which can introduce redshift dependence via cuts on apparent magnitude and colour. These effects of the selection function can be mitigated by further cutting the sample using k-corrected magnitudes and colours, to retain only those galaxies that would pass the targeting criteria for all redshifts within the interval considered.

 - **Abstract**
 A key open question in astrophysics is how plasma is transported within strongly magnetized, rapidly rotating systems. Magnetic reconnection and flux tube interchange are possible mechanisms, with Jupiter serving as the best local analog for distant systems. However, magnetic reconnection at Jupiter remains poorly understood. A key indicator of active magnetic reconnection is the ion diffusion region, but its detection at Jupiter has remained unconfirmed. Here, we report a unique magnetic reconnection event in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere that presents the first detection of an ion diffusion region. We provide evidence that this event involves localized flux tube interchange motion driven by centrifugal forces, which occurs inside a thin current sheet formed by the collision and twisting of two distinct flux tubes. This study provides new insights into Io-genic plasma transport at Jupiter and the unique role of magnetic reconnection in rapidly rotating systems, two key unresolved questions.

 - **Abstract**
 Comets and asteroids have long captured human curiosity, and until recently, all documented examples belonged to our Solar System. That changed with the discovery of the first known interstellar object, 1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua), in 2017. Two years later, Gennady Borisov discovered a second interstellar object: 2I/Borisov. From its initial images, the object's diffuse appearance hinted at its cometary nature. To better understand the photometric evolution of comet 2I as it traveled through the inner Solar System, we compiled observations using medium-sized telescopes. This data is crucial for gaining insights into its size and composition, as well as how such objects, after millions of years in interstellar space, behave when exposed to the Sun's radiation. Given that 2I is the first interstellar comet ever observed, constraining its behavior is of great scientific interest. In this paper, we present photometric data gathered from observatories in Crimea and Catalonia, highlighting the importance of systematic photometric studies of interstellar objects using meter-class telescopes. Our observations showed a steady increase in the comet's brightness as it approached perihelion, likely due to the slow sublimation of ices. Over the pre-perihelion observation period, we did not detect any significant changes in magnitude. The analysis of observations reveals a steady increase in comet brightness as it approached perihelion, likely due to the sublimation of ices, with no observable outbursts during the five-month pre-perihelion period. Additionally, we discuss the challenges in ground-based observation of comets posed by light pollution today, particularly in urban areas, where visual observations are severely limited. Using sample surface brightness measurements, we demonstrate the impact of light pollution and outline the importance of systematic photometric studies for interstellar objects.

 - **Abstract**
 The central $2\times0.8$ deg$^2$ region of our Galaxy contains $\sim10,000$ X-ray point sources that were detected by a series of Chandra observations over the last two decades. However, the limited bandpass of Chandra below 8 keV hampered their spectroscopic classification. In 2016, the initial NuSTAR Galactic center (GC) survey detected 77 X-ray sources above 10 keV (Hong et al. 2016). The hard X-ray detections indicate magnetic cataclysmic variables (CVs), low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), or even pulsars. The possibility of HMXB detections is particularly interesting given the dearth of identified HMXBs in the GC. We conducted a search for bright ($K_s\lt16$ mag) near-infrared (NIR) counterparts to the hard X-ray sources $-$ utilizing their Chandra positions $-$ in order to identify HMXB candidates. We identified seven NuSTAR sources with NIR counterpart candidates whose magnitudes are consistent with HMXBs at the GC. We assessed the likelihood of random association for these seven sources and determined that two have a non-random association with a probability exceeding $99.98\%$, making them strong HMXB candidates. We analyzed broadband NuSTAR, Chandra and XMM-Newton spectral data for these two candidates, one of which was previously identified as a red supergiant. We find that the X-ray spectra are consistent with HMXBs. If confirmed through follow-up NIR spectroscopic studies, our findings will open a new window into our understanding of the intrinsic luminosity distribution of HMXBs in our Galaxy in general and the GC HMXB population in particular.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first assessment of the perspectives to study the reheating epoch after cosmic inflation with the Ali Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization Telescope (AliCPT). AliCPT's sensitivity to the reheating temperature $T_{\text{re}}$ is primarily driven by its ability to detect primordial gravitational waves. Working in $\alpha$-attractor T-models of inflation and assuming a fiducial value of $r=0.01$, we find that AliCPT-1, in its fully loaded focal plane detector configuration and combined with Planck, can provide measurements of ${\rm log}_{10}(T_{\text{re}}[\text{GeV}]) = 12.04\pm2.55$. This translates into a bound on the inflaton coupling to other particles, requiring the related coupling constant to exceed the magnitude of the electron Yukawa coupling in the Standard Model if reheating is driven by an axion-like or Yukawa coupling. Our results are the first demonstration of AliCPT's ability to increase our knowledge about the initial temperature of the hot big bang and the microphysical parameter connecting cosmic inflation and particle physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares are frequently accompanied by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that release significant amount of energetic plasma into interplanetary space, potentially causing geomagnetic disturbances on Earth. However, many solar flares have no association with CMEs. The relationship between solar flare and CME occurrences remains unclear. Therefore, it is valuable to distinguish between active regions that potentially produce flares and CMEs and those that do not. It is believed that the eruptivity of a flare can be characterized by the properties of the active region from which it originates. In this study, we analyzed selected active regions that produced solar flares with and without CMEs during solar cycle 24. We carefully calculated the electric current neutralization of each active region by selecting relevant magnetic fluxes based on their connectivities using nonlinear force-free field models. Additionally, we analyzed their stabilities against the torus instability by estimating the proxies of critical heights of the active regions. We found that several non-eruptive active regions, which lacked clear signatures of neutral electric currents, exhibited a more apparent relationship with high critical heights of torus instability. Furthermore, we introduced a new non-dimensional parameter that incorporates current neutralization and critical height. We found that analysing ARs based on this new parameter can better discriminate eruptive and non-eruptive flare events compared to analysis that relied solely on current neutralization or torus instability. This indicates that torus instability analysis is necessary to complement electric current neutralization in characterizing the eruptivity of solar flares.

 - **Abstract**
 We present CO(1-0) observations of 50 star-forming galaxies at 0.01<z<0.35, for which 3.3$\,\mu$m PAH emission flux or its upper limit is available. A scaling relation between 3.3$\,\mu$m PAH luminosity and CO(1-0) luminosity is established covering ~2 orders of magnitude in total IR luminosity and CO luminosity, with a scatter of ~0.23 dex: $\mathrm{log}\,L_\mathrm{3.3}/\mathrm{L}_\odot=(1.00\pm0.07)\times\mathrm{log}\,L_\mathrm{CO(1-0)}^\prime/(\mathrm{K\,km\,s^{-1}\,pc^2})+(-1.10\pm0.70)$. The slope is near unity, allowing the use of a single value of $\langle\mathrm{log}\,(L_\mathrm{3.3}/L_\mathrm{CO(1-0)}^\prime)\rangle=-1.09\pm0.36~[\mathrm{L}_\odot/(\mathrm{K\,km\,s^{-1}\,pc^2})]$ in the conversion between 3.3$\,\mu$m PAH and CO luminosities. The variation in the $L_\mathrm{3.3}/L_\mathrm{CO}^\prime$ ratio is not dependent on the galaxy properties, including total IR luminosity, stellar mass, and SFR excess. The total gas mass, estimated using dust-to-gas ratio and dust mass, is correlated with 3.3$\,\mu$m PAH luminosity, in line with the prescription using $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}=0.8-4.5$ covering both normal star-forming galaxies and starburst galaxies. AGN-dominated galaxies tend to have a lower $L_\mathrm{3.3}/L_\mathrm{CO}^\prime$ than non-AGN galaxies, which needs to be investigated further with an increased sample size. The established $L_\mathrm{3.3}$-$L_\mathrm{CO}^\prime$ correlation is expected to be applicable to wide-field near-infrared spectrophotometric surveys that allow the detection of 3.3$\,\mu$m emission from numerous low-redshift galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 One proposed black hole formation channel involves hierarchical mergers, where black holes form through repeated binary mergers. Previous studies have shown that such black holes follow a near-universal spin distribution centered around 0.7. However, gravitational-wave kicks can eject remnants from their host environments, meaning only retained black holes can participate in subsequent mergers. We calculate the spin distribution of retained black holes in typical globular clusters, accounting for remnant kick velocities. Since the kick magnitude depends on the binary's mass ratio and spin orientations, certain configurations are more likely to be retained than others. This preferentially selects certain remnant spin magnitudes, skewing the spin distribution of second-generation black holes away from the universal distribution. In low escape velocity environments, the distribution can become bimodal, as remnants with spins of 0.7 typically receive larger kicks than other configurations. Regarding higher-generation black holes, their spin distribution does not converge to a unique form, and can span a broad range of spins, $a_f \in (0.4,1)$, depending on their merger history, birth spins and the escape velocity. Additionally, we find that the presence of a small fraction of binaries with near-aligned spins can produce a second, more dominant peak, whose position depends on the birth spin magnitude. Our findings identify observable features of hierarchical merger black holes, which is essential for understanding their contribution to the gravitational-wave population. Moreover, the dependence of the spin distribution on astrophysical parameters means that precise spin measurements could provide insights into their formation environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Void galaxies are located in the most underdense environments of the Universe, where the number density of galaxies is extremely low. They are, hence, good targets for studying the secular evolution of galaxies and the slow buildup of stellar mass through star formation. To date, very little is known about their cold gas content, both molecular (H$_2$) gas and atomic hydrogen (HI) gas. We present CO (1--0) observations of the H$_2$ gas disk in CG 910, which lies in the Boötes void, one of the largest nearby voids at relatively low redshifts (z$\sim$0.04-0.05). We used the Combined Array for Research in Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) to study the CO(1-0) distribution and gas kinematics in CG 910. We also carried out atomic hydrogen observations of the galaxy using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). The CARMA CO(1-0) observations reveal a molecular gas disk of mass, M(H$_{2}$) $\sim$12.0$\pm$1.1$\times$10$^{9}$M$_{\odot}$ and diameter 7 kpc. The CO velocity field shows a regularly rotating disk with a flat rotation velocity of 256 kms$^{-1}$ with no clear signatures of interaction or gas accretion. This is possibly the first CO (1-0) map of a void galaxy, and hence, important for understanding the molecular gas distribution and kinematics in void galaxies. The GBT observations reveal a HI disk of mass, M(HI) $\sim$3.1$\pm$0.8$\times$10$^{9}$M$_{\odot}$, which is relatively small compared to its stellar mass of M$_{\star}\sim$21.5$\times$10$^{9}M_{\odot}$. The total gas mass fraction, (M(H$_2$)+M(HI))/$M_{\star}$ and the atomic gas mass fraction, M(HI)/M$_{\star}$ for CG 910 are 0.70 and 0.14, respectively. We conclude that CG 910 has a regularly rotating but massive molecular gas disk. The lower atomic gas mass fraction and star formation rate indicate a longer gas depletion timescale, confirming that CG 910 is slowly evolving compared to normal disk galaxies.

 We search for galaxy protoclusters at redshifts $z > 1.5$ in the first data release (Q1) of the $\textit{Euclid}$ survey. We make use of the catalogues delivered by the $\textit{Euclid}$ Science Ground Segment (SGS). After a galaxy selection on the $H_\textrm{E}$ magnitude and on the photometric redshift quality, we undertake the search using the $\texttt{DETECTIFz}$ algorithm, an overdensity finder based on Delaunay tessellation that uses photometric redshift probability distributions through Monte Carlo simulations. In this pilot study, we conduct a search in the 11 $\textit{Euclid}$ tiles that contain previously known $\textit{Planck}$ high star-forming galaxy protocluster candidates and focus on the two detections that coincide with these regions. These counterparts lie at photometric redshifts $z_\textrm{ph}=1.63^{+0.19}_{-0.23}$ and $z_\textrm{ph}=1.56^{+0.18}_{-0.21}$ and have both been confirmed by two other independent protocluster detection algorithms. We study their colours, their derived stellar masses and star-formation rates, and we estimate their halo mass lower limits. We investigate whether we are intercepting these galaxy overdensities in their `dying' phase, such that the high star-formation rates would be due to their last unsustainable starburst before transitioning to groups or clusters of galaxies. Indeed, some galaxy members are found to lie above the main sequence of galaxies (star-formation rate versus stellar mass). These overdense regions occupy a specific position in the dark matter halo mass / redshift plane where forming galaxy clusters are expected to have experienced a transition between cold flows to shock heating in the halo. Finally, we empirically update the potential for galaxy protocluster discoveries at redshift up to $z \simeq3$ (wide survey) and $z \simeq5.5$ (deep survey) with $\textit{Euclid}$ for the next data release (DR1).

 - **Abstract**
 We report the azimuthal distribution of the X-ray energy spectrum of non-thermal dominant supernova remnant RX J0852.0$-$4622. The X-rays from the shock region observed by the X-ray astronomy satellite Suzaku/XIS in the energy range of 2-8 keV are well described by the absorbed power-law model and can be parameterized with flux and photon index. The X-ray flux and photon index are bimodally distributed in relation to the azimuthal angle. To understand its origin, we examined three possible causes: azimuthal variation by (1) the galactic magnetic field, (2) cloud density, and (3) shock velocity. From the polarization observations of stars near the SNR, we find that the Galactic magnetic field around the SNR is not aligned. This result leads us to conclude that the azimuthal variation of the X-ray spectrum is most likely not caused by the Galactic magnetic field. The X-ray fluxes are positively correlated with the cloud density with a significance of $\sim 5\sigma$, and the azimuthal distributions of these physical quantities are particularly pronounced in the northern part of the SNR. In addition, the X-ray fluxes on the southern part of the SNR are positively correlated with the shock velocity. This phenomenon can be qualitatively explained by the increase in roll-off energy due to the amplification of the magnetic field by (A) the interaction between the shock and dense clouds in the north and (B) the fast shock velocity in the south of the SNR. Since the shock velocity is likely related to the cloud density interacting with the shock, we conclude that the azimuthal variation of cloud density most likely causes the azimuthal variations of the X-ray flux and photon index.

 We report the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) polarimetric and simultaneous multiwavelength observations of the high-energy-peaked BL Lacertae (HBL) object 1ES 1959+650, performed in 2022 October and 2023 August. In 2022 October IXPE measured an average polarization degree $\Pi_{\rm X}=9.4\;\!\%\pm 1.6\;\!\%$ and an electric-vector position angle $\psi_{\rm X}=53^{\circ}\pm 5^{\circ}$. The polarized X-ray emission can be decomposed into a constant component, plus a rotating component, with rotation velocity $\omega_{\rm EVPA}=(-117\;\!\pm\;\!12)$ ${\rm deg}\;\!{\rm d}^{-1}$. In 2023 August, during a period of pronounced activity of the source, IXPE measured an average $\Pi_{\rm X}=12.4\;\!\%\pm0.7\;\!\%$ and $\psi_X=20^{\circ}\pm2^{\circ}$, with evidence ($\sim$0.4$\;\!\%$ chance probability) for a rapidly rotating component with $\omega_{\rm EVPA}=(1864\;\!\pm\;\!34)$ ${\rm deg}\;\!{\rm d}^{-1}$. These findings suggest the presence of a helical magnetic field in the jet of 1ES 1959+650 or stochastic processes governing the field in turbulent plasma. Our multiwavelength campaigns from radio to X-ray reveal variability in both polarization and flux from optical to X-rays. We interpret the results in terms of a relatively slowly varying component dominating the radio and optical emission, while rapidly variable polarized components dominate the X-ray and provide minor contribution at optical wavelengths. The radio and optical data indicate that on parsec scales the magnetic field is primarily orthogonal to the jet direction. On the contrary, X-ray measurements show a magnetic field almost aligned with the parsec jet direction. Confronting with other IXPE observations, we guess that the magnetic field of HBLs on sub-pc scale should be rather unstable, often changing its direction with respect to the VLBA jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares result from the rapid conversion of stored magnetic energy within the Sun's corona. These energy releases are associated with coronal magnetic loops, which are rooted in dense photospheric plasma and are passively transported by surface advection. Their emissions cover a wide range of wavelengths, with soft X-rays being the primary diagnostic for the past fifty years. Despite the efforts of multiple authors, we are still far from a complete theory, capable of explaining the observed statistical and individual properties of flares. Here, we exploit the availability of stable and long-term soft x-ray measurements from NASA's GOES mission to build a new solar flare catalogue, with a novel approach to linking sympathetic events. Furthermore, for the most energetic events since 2010, we have also provided a method to identify the origin of the observed flare and eventual link to the photospheric active region by exploiting the array of instruments onboard NASA's Solar Dynamic Observatory. Our catalogue provides a robust resource for studying space weather events and training machine learning models to develop a reliable early warning system for the onset of eruptive events in the solar atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars are one of the possible final stages in the evolution of massive stars. If a supernova explosion is anisotropic, it can give the pulsar a powerful kick, propelling it to supersonic speeds. The resulting pulsar wind nebula is significantly reshaped by its interaction with the surrounding medium as the pulsar moves through it. First, the pulsar crosses the supernova remnant, followed by the different layers of circumstellar medium formed during different stages of the progenitor star s evolution. We aim to investigate how the evolutionary history of massive stars shapes the bow shock nebulae of runaway kicked pulsars, and how these influences in turn affect the dynamics and non-thermal radio emission of the entire pulsar remnant. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the PLUTO code to model the pulsar wind nebula generated by a runaway pulsar in the supernova remnant of a red supergiant progenitor, and derive its non-thermal radio emission. The supernova remnant and the pre-supernova circumstellar medium of the progenitor strongly confine and reshape the pulsar wind nebula of the runaway pulsar, bending its two side jets inwards and giving the nebula an arched shape for an observer perpendicular to the jets and the propagation direction, as observed around PSR J1509 5850 and Gemina. We perform the first classical 3D model of a pulsar moving inward through its supernova ejecta and circumstellar medium, inducing a bending of its polar jet that turns into characteristic radio synchrotron signature. The circumstellar medium of young runaway pulsars has a significant influence on the morphology and emission of pulsar wind nebulae, whose comprehension requires a detailed understanding of the evolutionary history of the progenitor star.
#### The Evolving Power Spectrum for the light cone Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21-cm signal

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid evolution of the cosmological neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution during the EoR is imprinted along the line of sight (LoS) in the redshifted 21-cm signal due to the light cone (LC) effect. The LC EoR 21-cm signal ceases to be ergodic along the LoS, and the Fourier transform-based three-dimensional power spectrum (PS) fails to capture the full two-point statistics. Several earlier studies have used the multi-frequency angular power spectrum (MAPS) $\mathcal{C}_\ell(\nu_1,\nu_2)$ to overcome this limitation. However, we do not have a simple interpretation of $\mathcal{C}_\ell(\nu_1,\nu_2)$ in terms of comoving length scale, and the data volume is large. Here we introduce the evolving power spectrum (ePS) to quantify the two-point statistics of the LC EoR 21-cm signal. This has a simple interpretation in terms of redshift evolution and comoving length scales, and the binned ePS reduces the data volume by several orders of magnitude compared to MAPS. Considering simulations, we study the first three even angular multipoles of ePS to quantify the LoS anisotropy of the signal. We find that as reionization progresses, at large $k$ ($ \ge 0.6 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$), $P_{e\,0}(k,z)$ the monopole moment decreases as $\propto \bar{x}_{\rm H I}$ the mean neutral HI fraction, which, in principle, can be used to observationally determine the reionization history. Furthermore, $P_{e\,2}(k,z)$ the quadrupole moment is negative at small $k$ and positive at large $k$. We propose the binned ePS, which captures the entire information contained in MAPS, to quantify the full two-point statistics of the LC EoR 21-cm signal.

 - **Abstract**
 The Flashlights program with the Hubble Space Telescope imaged the six Hubble Frontier Fields galaxy clusters in two epochs and detected twenty transients. These are primarily expected to be caustic-crossing events (CCEs) where bright stars in distant lensed galaxies, typically at redshift $z\approx1$--3, get temporarily magnified close to cluster caustics. Since CCEs are generally biased toward more massive and luminous stars, they offer a unique route for probing the high end of the stellar mass function. We take advantage of the Flashlights event statistics to place preliminary constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) around cosmic noon. The photometry (along with spectral information) of lensed arcs is used to infer their various stellar properties, and stellar synthesis models are used to evolve a recent stellar population in them. We estimate the microlens surface density near each arc and, together with existing lens models and simple formalism for CCEs, calculate the expected rate for a given IMF. We find that, on average, a Salpeter-like IMF ($\alpha=2.35$) underpredicts the number of observed CCEs by a factor of ${\sim}0.7$, and a top-heavy IMF ($\alpha=1.00$) overpredicts by a factor of ${\sim}1.7$, suggesting that the average IMF slope may lie somewhere in between. However, given the large uncertainties associated with estimating the stellar populations, these results are strongly model-dependent. Nevertheless, we introduce a useful framework for constraining the IMF using CCEs. Observations with JWST are already yielding many more CCEs and will soon enable more stringent constraints on the IMF at a range of redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a high resolution zoom-in simulation of star cluster assembly including the merger of two sub-clusters with initial conditions taken from previous large scale giant molecular cloud (GMC) simulations. We couple hydrodynamics to N-body dynamics to simulate the individual stars themselves, and the gas-rich environment in which they evolve. We include prescriptions for star formation and stellar feedback and compare directly to previous simulations of the same region without these prescriptions to determine their role in shaping the dynamics inherited from the cluster assembly process. The stellar mass of the cluster grows through star formation within the cluster and accretion of new stars and star forming gas from a nearby filament. This growth results in an enhancement in the cluster's rotation and anisotropic expansion compared to simulations without star formation. We also analyze the internal kinematics of the cluster once it has lost most of its gas and find that the rotational velocity and the velocity anisotropy profiles are qualitatively similar to those expected of clusters that have undergone violent relaxation. As well, rotation and anisotropic expansion are still present by the time of gas removal. This implies that evolution within the GMC was unable to completely erase the kinematics inherited by the merger.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy clusters in the local Universe are dominated by massive quiescent galaxies with old ages, formed at high redshifts. It is debated whether their quenching is driven by internal processes or environmental effects, which has been challenging due to the lack of observations during their peak formation epoch. Here we report clear evidence from ALMA of extended and elongated gas tails in nine galaxies in a forming cluster at z = 2.51. The distinct gas distribution compared to the stellar emission probed by JWST, which is rather isolated without signatures of mergers or interactions, provides evidence of ram-pressure stripping (RPS). This represents the most distant confirmed case of RPS, highlighting the critical role of environmental effects in gas removal at high redshifts, an often overlooked quenching pathway.
