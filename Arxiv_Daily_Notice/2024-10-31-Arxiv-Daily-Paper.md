 - **Abstract**
 The recent tension in the value of the cosmological parameter $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_M/0.3)^{1/2}$, which represents the amplitude of the matter density fluctuations of the universe, has not been resolved. In this work, we present constraints on $S_8$ with the X-ray angular power spectra of clusters and groups measured with the half-sky map from the eROSITA All Sky Survey data release 1 (eRASS1). Thanks to the extensive sky coverage of eRASS1, its power spectrum achieves unprecedented precision compared to previous measurements. Using a well-calibrated, physical halo gas model that includes astrophysics of feedback and non-thermal pressure support, we obtain $S_8 = 0.80^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ with 1$\sigma$ uncertainty that is competitive against other cosmological probes. Our derived $S_8$ value is smaller than the primary CMB measurements from Planck, but still consistent to within $1\sigma$. We also obtain constraints on the astrophysics of feedback, non-thermal pressure, equation of state in cluster cores, and gas boundaries in clusters and groups. We discuss how additional X-ray observations, and cosmological surveys in microwave and optical, will further improve the cosmological constraints with the angular power spectrum. Our work demonstrates that the angular power spectrum of clusters and groups is a promising probe of both cosmology and astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 Most black holes (BHs) formed in collapsing stars have low spin, though some are expected to acquire a magnetic accretion disk during the collapse. While such BH disks can launch magnetically driven winds, their physics and observational signatures have remained unexplored. We present global 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsing stars that form slowly spinning BHs with accretion disks. As the disk transitions to a magnetically arrested state, it drives mildly relativistic, wobbling, collimated magnetic outflows through two mechanisms: steady outflows along vertical magnetic field lines (''Blandford-Payne jets'') and magnetic flux eruptions. With an isotropic-equivalent energy of $E_{\rm iso}\approx10^{52}\,{\rm erg}$, exceeding that of relativistic jets from BHs with spin $a\lesssim 0.25$, the disk outflows unbind the star, ultimately capping the final BH mass at $ M_{\rm BH} \approx 4\,M_\odot$. Once the outflows emerge from the star, they produce mildly relativistic shock breakout, cooling, and $^{56}{\rm Ni}$-decay emission. Our cooling emission estimates suggest a bright near-ultraviolet and optical signal at absolute magnitude $M_{\rm AB}\approx-16$ lasting for several days. This indicates that disk winds could be responsible for the first peak in the double-peaked light curves observed in Type Ib/c supernovae (SNe) or power another class of transients. The detection rate in the upcoming Rubin Observatory and ULTRASAT/UVEX will enable us to differentiate between competing models for the origin of the first SN peak and provide constraints on the physics and formation rate of accretion disks in core-collapse SNe.
#### Structural Decomposition of Merger-Free Galaxies Hosting Luminous AGNs

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nucleus (AGN) growth in disk-dominated, merger-free galaxies is poorly understood, largely due to the difficulty in disentangling the AGN emission from that of the host galaxy. By carefully separating this emission, we examine the differences between AGNs in galaxies hosting a (possibly) merger-grown, classical bulge, and AGNs in secularly grown, truly bulgeless disk galaxies. We use GALFIT to obtain robust, accurate morphologies of 100 disk-dominated galaxies imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope. Adopting an inclusive definition of classical bulges, we detect a classical bulge component in $53.3 \pm 0.5$ per cent of the galaxies. These bulges were not visible in Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometry, however these galaxies are still unambiguously disk-dominated, with an average bulge-to-total luminosity ratio of $0.1 \pm 0.1$. We find some correlation between bulge mass and black hole mass for disk-dominated galaxies, though this correlation is significantly weaker in comparison to the relation for bulge-dominated or elliptical galaxies. Furthermore, a significant fraction ($\gtrsim 90$ per cent) of our black holes are overly massive when compared to the relationship for elliptical galaxies. We find a weak correlation between total stellar mass and black hole mass for the disk-dominated galaxies, hinting that the stochasticity of black hole-galaxy co-evolution may be higher disk-dominated than bulge-dominated systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) reflect signatures of the underlying gravitational potential, mergers and strong interactions with other halos and satellite galaxies, as well as galactic feedback from supernovae and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Traditionally, clusters have been characterized in terms of summary statistics, such as halo mass, X-ray luminosity, cool-core state, luminosity of AGN, and number of merging components. In this paper of the Extracting Reality from Galaxy Observables with Machine Learning series (ERGO-ML), we instead consider the full information content available in maps of X-ray emission from the ICM. We employ Nearest Neighbour Contrastive Learning (NNCLR) to identify and populate a low-dimensional representation space of such images. Using idealized X-ray maps of the 352 clusters of the TNG-Cluster cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation suite, we take three orthogonal projections of each cluster at eight snapshots within the redshift range $0\leq z<1$, resulting in a dataset of $\sim$8,000 images. Our findings reveal that this representation space forms a continuous distribution from relaxed to merging objects, and from centrally-peaked to flat emission profiles. The representation also exhibits clear trends with redshift, with halo, gas, stellar, and SMBH mass, with time since a last major merger, and with indicators of dynamical state. We show that an 8-dimensional representation can be used to predict a variety of cluster properties, find analogs, and identify correlations between physical properties, thereby suggesting causal relationships. Our analysis demonstrates that contrastive learning is a powerful tool for characterizing galaxy clusters from their images alone, allowing us to derive constraints on their physical properties and formation histories using cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy simulations.
#### Hints of auroral and magnetospheric polarized radio emission from the scallop-shell star 2MASS J05082729$-$2101444

 - **Abstract**
 Scallop-shell stars, a recently discovered class of young M dwarfs, show complex optical light curves that are characterized by periodic dips as well as other features that are stable over tens to hundreds of rotation cycles. The origin of these features is not well-understood. 2MASS J05082729$-$2101444 is a $\sim$25 Myr old scallop-shell star that was identified using TESS data; it has a photometric period of 6.73h that has been attributed to rotation. Of the $\sim$50 recently confirmed scallop-shell stars, it is one of the few detected at radio frequencies between 1 and 8 GHz. We observed this rare system with the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope at 575--720 MHz, covering 88% of the photometric period in each of the two observations scheduled almost a month apart in 2023. We detected $\sim$millijansky emission from the target in both epochs, with a significant circular polarization fraction: $|V/I|\sim$20--50%. The 3.5-min phase-folded light curves reveal unique variability in circular polarization, showing an $\sim$hour-long helicity reversal in both epochs, similar in amplitude, length, and (possibly) phase. These results suggest two emission components: The first is a persistent, moderately polarized component possibly ascribable to gyro-synchrotron emission driven by centrifugal breakout events. The second is a highly polarized, short burst-like component, likely due to an electron cyclotron maser (ECM), indicative of auroral emission and potentially responsible for the helicity reversal. To explain this, we discuss the different origins of the plasma responsible for the radio emission, including the possibility that the occulting material is acting as a plasma source. Future coordinated multifrequency radio and optical observations can further constrain the underlying scenario, as well as the magnetic geometry of the system, if we assume an ECM-like auroral emission.
#### First results from the JWST Early Release Science Program Q3D: AGN photoionization and shock4 ionization in a red quasar at z = 0.45

 - **Abstract**
 Red quasars, often associated with potent [OIII] outflows on both galactic and circumgalactic scales, may play a pivotal role in galactic evolution and black hole feedback. In this work, we explore the [FeII] emission in one such quasar at redshift z = 0.4352, F2M J110648.32+480712.3, using the integral field unit (IFU) mode of the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our observations reveal clumpy [FeII] gas located to the south of the quasar. By comparing the kinematics of [FeII] and [OIII], we find that the clumpy [FeII] gas in the southeast and southwest aligns with the outflow, exhibiting similar median velocities up to v_50 ~ 1200 km/s and high velocity widths W_80 > 1000 km/s. In contrast, the [FeII] gas to the south shows kinematics inconsistent with the outflow, with W_80 ~ 500 km/s, significantly smaller than the [OIII] at the same location, suggesting that the [FeII] may be confined within the host galaxy. Utilizing standard emission-line diagnostic ratios, we map the ionization sources of the gas. According to the MAPPINGS III shock models for [FeII]/Pabeta, the regions to the southwest and southeast of the quasar are primarily photoionized. Conversely, the [FeII] emission to the south is likely excited by shocks generated by the back-pressure of the outflow on the galaxy disk, a direct signature of the impact of the quasar on its host.

 - **Abstract**
 Source detection is a vital part of any astronomical survey analysis pipeline. In addition, a versatile source finder that can recover and handle sources of all morphological types is becoming more important as surveys get bigger and achieve a higher resolution than ever before. Here we present Detector of astRonomical soUrces in optIcal and raDio images (DRUID), a source finder that utilises persistent homology to detect and deblend sources. This method enables us to effectively and uniquely segment structures within morphologically complex sources and deal with high source density images. We test DRUID on the complex morphologies of 3CR radio loud active galactic nuclei, where we demonstrate its ability to usefully segment the main structures in the sources. We also demonstrate the level of structure DRUID segments within well resolved galaxies in the optical. Finally, we present two source catalogues on the LoTSS Deep field observation of the Lockman Hole and an example tile from the KiDS r-band survey. We conclude that DRUID's method of utilising persistent homology provides a new way to detect and deblend highly nested sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole low-mass X-ray binaries undergo quiescence-outburst cycles. During the outbursts, they typically go through a q-shaped pattern in the hardness-intensity diagram (HID), known as the hysteresis q-diagram, while the physical nature is still unknown. We argue that the hysteresis q-diagram can be well explained with a recently proposed magnetized accretion disk model. The model takes into account the saturated magnetic pressure and predicts that the standard Shakura-Sunyaev disk (SSD) has an inner truncation at relatively low accretion rates, filled with an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) inside. Given a perturbation of accretion rate, the variation of the truncation radius can be derived as a result of thermal equilibrium by comparing the heating and cooling rates. We show that the truncation radius displays a hysteresis effect in response to the variation of mass accretion rate. As a result, the spectral hardness due to competition of the soft SSD and hard ADAF components is also hysteresis along with the rise and decay of the mass accretion rate or source intensity, leading to a q-shaped diagram in the HID.

 - **Abstract**
 Changing-Look Active Galactic Nuclei (CLAGN) are characterised by extreme variations in line emission over short timescales, mostly affecting broad H$\beta$ lines. While a few hundred CLAGN are known, a complete sample of turn-on CLAGN is still elusive. Here, we present a search for turn-on CLAGN in a complete sample of galaxies, using archival spectra and recent light curves. We obtained light curves from the Asteroid Terrestrial Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) for 16,232 emission line galaxies, including both star-forming and active galaxies, at $z<0.1$ with spectra from the Six-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS). We first establish typical variability behaviour for different AGN types, as recorded between 2001 and 2009, and then select outliers from the bulk behaviour as CLAGN candidates. We obtain new spectra for the candidates and identify 12 new turn-on CLAGN (appearing broad H$\beta$ line) and 19 new turn-off CLAGN (disappearing broad H$\beta$ line). We may have missed AGN that changed and reverted their state over the 15$-$20 years since 6dFGS spectra were taken, and thus our CLAGN rates of 1.7$\%$ for turn-on and 9.6$\%$ for turn-off are lower limits. The turn-on rate is naturally much lower as the type 1.9/2 sample is dominated by obscured AGN due to orientation, which are not expected to change. However, the number of turn-on (27) and turn-off (24) CLAGN we find are similar, suggesting that our parent AGN sample is reasonably complete in our search volume at $z<0.1$.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we carry out multiwavelength and multiview observations of the prominence eruption, which generates a C2.3 class flare and a coronal mass ejection (CME) on 2023 March 7. For the first time, we apply the revised cone model to three-dimension reconstruction and tracking of the eruptive prominence for ~4 hrs. The prominence propagates non-radially and makes a detour around the large-scale coronal loops in active region NOAA 13243. The northward deflection angle increases from ~36 degrees to ~47 degrees before returning to ~36 degrees and keeping up. There is no longitudinal deflection throughout the propagation. The angular width of the cone increases from ~30 degrees and reaches a plateau at ~37 degrees. The heliocentric distance of the prominence rises from ~1.1 to ~10.0 solar radii, and the prominence experiences continuous acceleration (~51 m/s^2) over two hours, which is probably related to the magnetic reconnection during the C-class flare. The true speed of CME front is estimated to be ~829 km/s, which is ~1.2 times larger than that of CME core (prominence). It is concluded that both acceleration and deflection of eruptive prominences in their early lives could be reproduced with the revised cone model.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. To date, more than 5000 exoplanets have been discovered. The large majority of these planets have a mass between 1 and 17 {M_\oplus}, making them so-called super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. The exact formation process for this abundant planet population has not yet been fully constrained. Aims. Recent studies on the formation of these planets make various assumptions with regard to the disk. The primary mass budget, held in pebbles, is either assumed to have a constant size or is parametrized as a flux. Simplifications of the temperature structure, in the form of a static power law, do not consider the temperature evolution and high magnitudes of heating in the inner part of the disk. In this study, we aim to investigate the effect these simplifications of temperature and pebble sizes have on the pebble densities and resulting planet populations. Methods. To constrain the timescales needed to form super-Earths, we developed a model for exploring a large parameter space. We included the effect of two different temperature prescriptions on a viscously accreting and spreading disk. We formed a pebble reservoir utilizing a simplified conversion timescale with a time- and radially dependent Stokes number for the dust. We then tracked the temporal evolution of the surface densities of gas, dust, and pebbles. Pebbles were allowed to drift and be accreted onto a growing protoplanet. As a planet grows, it exerts a torque on the disk, carving out a gap and affecting the pebble drift, before halting the growth of the planet.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose novel numerical schemes based on the Boris method in curved spacetime, incorporating both hadronic and radiative interactions for the first time. Once the proton has lost significant energy due to radiative and hadronic losses, and its gyroradius has decreased below typical scales on which the electromagnetic field varies, we apply a guiding center approximation (GCA). We fundamentally simulate collision processes either with a Monte-Carlo method or, where applicable, as a continuous energy loss, contingent on the local optical depth. To test our algorithm for the first time combining the effects of electromagnetic, gravitational, and radiation fields including hadronic interactions, we simulate highly relativistic protons traveling through various electromagnetic fields and proton backgrounds. We provide unit tests in various spatially dependent electromagnetic and gravitational fields and background photon and proton distributions, comparing the trajectory against analytic results. We propose that our method can be used to analyze hadronic interactions in black hole accretion disks, jets, and coronae to study the neutrino abundance from active galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 Large gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events can pose a radiation risk to crewed spaceflight and a significant threat to near-Earth satellites however, the origin of the SEP seed particle population, how these particles are released, accelerated and transported into the heliosphere are not well understood. We analyse NOAA active region (AR) 12673, that was the source responsible for multiple large gradual SEP events during September 2017, and found that almost immediately after each significant eruptive event associated with SEPs an enhanced Si/S abundance ratio was measured by Wind, consistent with the previous work by Brooks et al. Hinode/EIS took data roughly 8~hours before the second SEP event on 2017 September 6 that allowed the regions of enhanced Si/S abundance ratio in the AR to be determined. We have shown that the AR contains plasma with elemental abundance values detected in situ by Wind. In particular, the plasma originates from the core of the AR, similar to Brooks et al., but in the moss (footpoints) associated with hot sigmoidal AR loops. The sigmoid, that contains highly fractionated plasma, erupts and propagates towards an Earth-connected magnetic null point, providing a direct channel for the highly fractionated plasma to escape and be detected in the near-Earth environment.

 - **Abstract**
 The Parameterized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism offers an agnostic framework for evaluating theories of gravity that extend beyond General Relativity. Departures from General Relativity are represented by a set of dimensionless parameters that, at the first order in the expansion, reduce to $\beta$ and $\gamma$, which describe deviations in spatial curvature and non-linear superposition effects of gravity, respectively. We exploit future observations of stars at the Galactic Center, orbiting the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, to forecast the ability to constrain the first-order PPN parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$. We have generated a mock catalog of astrometric and spectroscopic data for S2, based on the Schwarzschild metric, simulating observations over multiple orbital periods with the GRAVITY and SINFONI instruments. Our analysis includes the effects of relativistic orbital precession and line-of-sight (LOS) velocity gravitational redshift. Since future data for S2 can provide constraints only on a linear combination of the PPN parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ we also analyzed the impact of future observations of the gravitational lensing for stars that pass closer in the sky to Sgr A*, like the known star S62, which can potentially provide tight constraints on the parameter $\gamma$, that alone regulates the amplitude of the astrometric deviations due to lensing. When combining lensing observations for S62, and the precise orbital tracking of S2, one obtains independent constraints on both $\gamma$ (with a potential precision as good as $\sim 1\%$) and $\beta$ (with a corresponding precision of $\sim 2\%$), providing a precision test of General Relativity and its extensions.
#### Investigating the hadron nature of high-energy photons with PeVatrons

 - **Abstract**
 In high energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy with shower arrays the most discriminating signature of the photon-induced showers against the background of hadron-induced cosmic-ray is the content of muons in the observed events. In the electromagnetic $\gamma$-showers the muon production is mainly due to the photo-production of pions followed by the decay $\pi\to\mu\nu$. In high energy photo-production process the photon exhibits an internal structure which is very similar to that of hadrons. Indeed, photon-hadron interactions can be understood if the physical photon is viewed as a superposition of a bare photon and an accompanying small hadronic component which feels conventional hadronic interactions. Information on photo-production $\gamma$p and $\gamma\gamma$ cross-sections are limited to $\sqrt{s}\leq$ 200 GeV from data collected at HERA. Starting from $E_{lab}\approx$100 TeV the difference between different extrapolations of the cross sections increases to more than 50\% at $E_{lab}\approx$10$^{19}$ eV, with important impact on a number of shower observables and on the selection of the photon-initiated air showers. Recently, the LHAASO experiment opened the PeV-sky to observations detecting 40 PeVatrons in a background-free regime starting from about $E_{lab}\approx$ 100 TeV. This result provides a beam of pure high energy primary photons allowing to measure for the first time the photo-production cross section even at energies not explored yet. The future air shower array SWGO in the Southern Hemisphere, where the existence of Super-Pevatrons emitting photons well above the PeV is expected, could extend the study of the hadron nature of the photons in the PeV region. In this contribution the opportunity for a measurement of the photo-production cross section with air shower arrays is presented and discussed.
#### Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XXI. The totally-eclipsing B-type system IQ Persei

 - **Abstract**
 IQ Per is a totally-eclipsing binary system containing a B8 V star and an A6 V star in an orbit of period 1.744 d with eccentricity and apsidal motion. We use new light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and published spectroscopy from Lacy & Frueh (1985) to measure the physical properties of the component stars, finding masses of 3.516 +/- 0.050 Msun and 1.738 +/- 0.023 Msun, and radii of 2.476 +/- 0.015 Rsun and 1.503 +/- 0.016 Rsun. Our fit to the light curve is imperfect, with a small sinusoidal trend in the residuals versus orbital phase and a slight mismatch in the depth of secondary eclipse, but the total eclipses mean the system is still well-characterised. The distance to the system from its masses, temperatures, apparent magnitudes and bolometric corrections is in agreement with the parallax distance from Gaia DR3. Theoretical models cannot adequately match the measured properties of the system, and new spectroscopy to confirm the temperatures and determine the chemical compositions of the stars would be useful. A Fourier analysis of the residuals of the best fit to the light curve shows many peaks at multiples of the orbital frequency, and one significant peak at 1.33 c/d which is not. This pulsation and the properties of the primary component are consistent with it being a slowly-pulsating B star.

 - **Abstract**
 Utilizing a range of techniques including multi-band light curves, softness ratio analysis, structure functions, rms spectra, cross-correlation functions, and ratios of spectra from different intervals, we present a comprehensive study of the complex X-ray spectral variability in Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 120, through re-analyzing its six XMM-Newton observations taken between 2003 and 2014. We find a clear ''softer-when-brighter" trend in the 2--10 keV power-law component over long timescales, with this trend being timescale dependent, as it is much weaker on shorter timescales, similar to that previously detected in NGC 4051. Notably, a rare ''harder-when-brighter" trend is observed during one exposure, indicating dynamic changes in the spectral variability behavior of the power-law component. This exceptional exposure, with the spectral variability indeed marked by a power-law pivoting at an unusually low energy of ~ 2 keV, suggests intricate variations in the thermal Comptonization processes within the corona. Furthermore, when the data below 2 keV are included, we identify that the soft excess component adds significant complexity to the spectral variability, such as evidenced by a transition from ''harder-when-brighter'' to ''softer-when-brighter'' during another single exposure. Such extra complexity arises because the variability of the soft excess sometimes follows and sometimes does not follow the changes in the power-law component. Our findings underscore the necessity of applying multiple analytic techniques to fully capture the multifaceted spectral variability of AGNs.

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric galaxy surveys, despite their limited resolution along the line of sight, encode rich information about the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe thanks to the large number density and extensive depth of the data. However, the complicated selection effects in wide and deep surveys will potentially cause significant bias in the angular two-point correlation function (2PCF) measured from those surveys. In this paper, we measure the 2PCF from the newly published KiDS-Legacy sample. Given an $r$-band $5\sigma$ magnitude limit of $24.8$ and survey footprint of $1347$ deg$^2$, it achieves an excellent combination of sky coverage and depth for such a measurement. We find that complex selection effects, primarily induced by varying seeing, introduce over-estimation of the 2PCF by approximately an order of magnitude. To correct for such effects, we apply a machine learning-based method to recover an ``organised random'' (OR) that presents the same selection pattern as the galaxy sample. The basic idea is to find the selection-induced clustering of galaxies using a combination of self-organising maps (SOM) and hierarchical clustering (HC). This unsupervised machine learning method is able to recover complicated selection effects without specifying their functional forms. We validate this ``SOM+HC'' method on mock deep galaxy samples with realistic systematics and selections derived from the KiDS-Legacy catalogue. Using mock data, we demonstrate that the OR delivers unbiased 2PCF cosmological parameter constraints, removing the $27\sigma$ offset in the galaxy bias parameter that is recovered when adopting uniform randoms. Blinded measurements on the real KiDS-Legacy data show that the corrected 2PCF is robust to the SOM+HC configuration near the optimal setup suggested by the mock tests. Our software is open-source for future usage.

 - **Abstract**
 One way in which we can attempt to relate chemical pathways to geochemical environments is by studying the kinetics of a given sequence of reactions and identifying the conditions under which this chemistry is the most productive. Many prebiotic reactions rely on a source of fixed carbon, therefore chemical pathways that suggest prebiotically plausible ways of fixing carbon are of significant interest. One such pathway is the carboxysulfitic reaction network which uses solvated electrons, produced as a result of electron photodetachment from sulfite, to reduce carbon. In this work we explore carboxysulfitic chemistry at three different pH values: 6, 9, and 12. We utilise a new light source, that matches the broadband spectral shape of the young Sun, to irradiate a mixture of bicarbonate and sulfite. We determine the rate equation for the production of formate from these compounds and find the order to be 0.71 $\pm$ 0.12 with respect to bicarbonate and -0.60 $\pm$ 0.10 with respect to sulfite. Following this, we determine rate constants for the production of formate considering two different mechanisms. We find this chemistry to be feasible at all three of the pH values tested, with the magnitude of the rate constants being highly dependent on the assumed mechanism. We suggest that these results may have implications for Mars Sample Return owing to Jezero Crater having had lakes similar to those in which we propose carboxysulfitic chemistry to have been the most productive. Due to Mars' relatively unaltered surface, we propose that Mars Sample Return missions could look for preserved tracers of this chemistry, shedding light on Mars' past conditions and its potential for having hosted life.

 - **Abstract**
 Global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models play an important role in the infrastructure of space weather forecasting. Validating such models commonly utilizes in situ solar wind measurements made near the orbit of the Earth. The purpose of this study is to test the performance of G3DMHD (a data driven, time-dependent, 3-D MHD model of the solar wind) with Parker Solar Probe (PSP) measurements. Since its launch in August 2018, PSP has traversed the inner heliosphere at different radial distances sunward of the Earth (the closest approach ~13.3 solar radii), thus providing a good opportunity to study evolution of the solar wind and to validate heliospheric models of the solar wind. The G3DMHD model simulation is driven by a sequence of maps of photospheric field extrapolated to the assumed source surface (2.5 Rs) using the potential field model from 2018 to 2022, which covers the first 15 PSP orbits. The Pearson correlation coefficient (cc) and the mean absolute squared error (MASE) are used as the metrics to evaluate the model performance. It is found that the model performs better for both magnetic intensity (cc = 0.75; MASE = 0.60) and the solar wind density (cc = 0.73; MASE = 0.50) than for the solar wind speed (cc = 0.15; MASE = 1.29) and temperature (cc = 0.28; MASE = 1.14). This is due primarily to lack of accurate boundary conditions. The well-known underestimate of the magnetic field in solar minimum years is also present. Assuming that the radial magnetic field becomes uniformly distributed with latitude at or below 18 Rs (the inner boundary of the computation do-main), the agreement in the magnetic intensity significantly improves (cc = 0.83; MASE = 0.49).

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a comprehensive temporal and spectral study of the FSRQ PKS 0805-07 by using the broadband observations from the Fermi-LAT and Swift-XRT/UVOT instruments over the period MJD 54684-60264. The 3-day binned $\gamma$-ray light curve during the active state, revealed eleven distinct peak structures with the maximum integral flux (E $>$ 100 MeV) reached $(1.56\pm 0.16)\times10^{-6}\, \text{photons cm}^{-2}\, \text{s}^{-1}$ on MJD 59904.5. The shortest observed $\gamma$-ray variability was $2.80\pm 0.77$ days. A correlation analysis between the $\gamma$-ray spectral index and flux indicated the typical trend of hardening when the source is brighter, commonly observed in blazars. We identified a lag of 121 (+27.21, -3.51) days in the spectral index relative to the flux, within the time interval MJD 59582 to 60112. The Anderson-Darling test and histogram-fit rejected the normality of the $\gamma$-ray flux distribution, and instead suggest a log-normal distribution. To gain insight into the underlying physical processes, we extracted broadband spectra from different time periods in the light curve. The spectral energy distribution during various flux states were well-reproduced using synchrotron, synchrotron-self-Compton, and external-Compton emissions from a broken power-law electron distribution. The seed photons required for the external Compton process are from IR region. A comparison of the best-fit physical parameters indicated that the variations in different flux states were primarily associated with an increase in the bulk Lorentz factor and magnetic field from low to high flux states.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we studied the broadband temporal and spectral properties of the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) Ton 599 and explored the one-zone leptonic model to fit the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). We collected the long-term data from June 2020 to August 2024 when the source was in a long flaring episode. We used the Bayesian block methodology to identify the various flux states which included three flares. The broadband fractional variability is estimated during two flaring states and in the total light curve. The Fvar distribution with respect to frequency shows a double hump structure similar to broadband SED. The Power spectral density (PSD) shows a pink-noise kind of stochastic variability in the light curve and we do not see any break in the power spectrum suggesting a much longer characteristic time scale is involved in gamma-ray variability. The flux distribution is well-fitted with a double log-normal flux distribution suggesting the variability of non-linear in nature. The gamma-ray, optical, and X-ray emissions were found to be highly correlated with a zero time lag suggesting a co-spatial origin. We used the one-zone leptonic model to reproduce the broad-band spectrum in the energy range from IR to very high-energy gamma-ray. The increase in the magnetic field and the Doppler factor were found to be the main cause for high flux states. The XMM-Newton spectra taken during one of the flaring durations exhibit a signature of black body emission from the accretion disk suggesting a possible disk-jet coupling. This has also been indicated by the gamma-ray flux distribution which shows the distribution as non-linear in nature mostly seen in galactic X-ray binaries or AGN where emission is dominated by the accretion disk. This possibility of disk-jet coupling will be explored in the coming works.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic field vector of the solar corona is not regularly and comprehensively being measured, because of the complexity and degeneracy inherently present in the types of observations currently available. To address some of the current limitations of coronal polarimetry, we present computations that demonstrate the possibility of magnetometry using the unsaturated Hanle effect of the He I 1083 nm line. The main purpose of this investigation is to show how the geometric properties of the linear polarization of this line can be used to routinely diagnose the orientation of the field in erupting prominences, thus providing an important constraint on the B$_z$ determination at 1 AU. For this work, we adopted a simplified magnetic model of a flux rope, consisting of a toroidal helical structure embedded in a hydrostatically stratified corona. Our results demonstrate the possibility to discern different orientations of the magnetic field vector in such structures under rather general and practicable viewing conditions. In particular, observations from the Sun-Earth Lagrange points are found to provide excellent locations for the deployment of synoptic instruments aiming at the estimation of the magnetic field of Earth-directed Coronal Mass Ejections. We complete our demonstration by showing how a small (~5 cm) space-borne coronagraph can achieve sufficient signal-to-noise ratios to make the coronal magnetometry goal outlined above feasible.

 - **Abstract**
 Building on a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) jet with initial magnetization $\sigma_0=150$, propagating through the dynamical ejecta from a binary neutron star merger, we identify regions of energy dissipation driven by magnetic reconnection and collisionless sub-shocks within different scenarios. We solve the transport equations for photons, electrons, protons, neutrinos, and intermediate particles up to the photosphere, accounting for all relevant radiative processes, including electron and proton acceleration, and investigate the potential impact of magnetic reconnection occurring in different regions along the jet. We find the photon spectra undergo non-thermal modifications below the photosphere, observable in both on-axis and off-axis emission directions, as well as across different scenarios of energy dissipation and subsequent particle acceleration. Interestingly, the spectral index of the photon energy distribution can at most vary by $\sim20\%$ across all different dissipation scenarios. Depending on the dissipation mechanism at play, neutrino signatures may accompany the photon signal, pointing to efficient proton acceleration and shedding light on jet physics. Although our findings are based on one jet simulation, they point to a potential universal origin of the non-thermal features of the Band spectrum observed in sGRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Merging supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries will likely be surrounded by a circumbinary accretion disk. Close to merger, gravitational radiation-driven inspiral will happen on timescales faster than the effective viscous time at the disk cavity wall, leading to a decoupling of the inner binary dynamics from the surrounding gaseous environment. Here we perform the first simulation of this decoupling process from a magnetically arrested circumbinary accretion disk. In this regime, the central cavity is filled with very strong vertical magnetic flux, regulating accretion onto the binary. Our simulations identify three main stages of this process: (1) Large-scale magnetic flux loss prior to decoupling. (2) Rayleigh-Taylor-driven accretion streams onto the binary during and after decoupling, which can power magnetic tower-like outflows, resembling dual jets. (3) Post merger, the cavity wall becomes unstable and the magnetic flux trapped inside the cavity will get ejected in large coherent outbreak episodes with implications for potential multi-messenger transients to merging SMBH binaries.
