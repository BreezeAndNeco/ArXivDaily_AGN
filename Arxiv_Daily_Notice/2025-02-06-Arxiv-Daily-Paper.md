#### Cosmic quenching

 - **Abstract**
 The quenching of star formation activity represents a critical phase for a non-negligible fraction of the observed galaxy population at all cosmic epochs, marking a transition from an epoch of intense mass growth to an extended period of passive evolution. Over the past years, we have collected a detailed characterization of how the fraction of quenched galaxies evolves as a function of cosmic time (it grows at later cosmic epochs), and correlates with the physical properties of galaxies (more massive galaxies, that also tend to be bulge-dominated, are more likely to be quenched) and with their environment (denser environments host larger fractions of quiescent galaxies). Different physical processes can lead to a suppression of star formation. These include internal processes (processes that do not depend on the environment in which galaxies live, e.g. stellar and AGN feedback mechanisms) and processes that instead depend on the environment (e.g. mergers, gas stripping processes). In this chapter, we summarize the observational and theoretical status of the field, highlighting the most recent results and the questions that are yet to be answered. We also summarize our view on the expected developments in the next few years.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent experimental results on the arrival direction of high-energy cosmic rays have motivated studies to understand their propagating environment. The observed anisotropy is shaped by interstellar and local magnetic fields. In coherent magnetic structures, such as the heliosphere, or due to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, magnetic mirroring can temporarily trap particles, leading to chaotic behavior. In this work, we develop a new method to characterize cosmic rays' chaotic behavior in magnetic systems using finite-time Lyapunov exponents. This quantity determines the degree of chaos and adapts to transitory behavior. We study particle trajectories in an axial-symmetric magnetic bottle to highlight mirroring effects. By introducing time-dependent magnetic perturbations, we study how temporal variations affect chaotic behavior. We tailor our model to the heliosphere; however, it can represent diverse magnetic configurations exhibiting mirroring phenomena. Our results have three key implications. (1)Theoretical: We find a correlation between the finite-time Lyapunov exponent and the particle escape time from the system, which follows a power law that persists even under additional perturbations. This power law may reveal intrinsic system characteristics, offering insight into propagation dynamics beyond simple diffusion. (2)Simulation: Chaotic effects play a role in cosmic ray simulations and can influence the resulting anisotropy maps. (3)Observational: Arrival maps display areas where the chaotic properties vary significantly; these changes can be the basis for time variability in the anisotropy maps. This work lays the framework for studying the effects of magnetic mirroring of cosmic rays within the heliosphere and the role of temporal variability in the observed anisotropy.
#### Stars as cosmic scales: measuring stellar mass with microlensed supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational microlensing is a unique probe of the stellar content in strong lens galaxies. Flux ratio anomalies from gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe), just like lensed quasars, can be used to constrain the stellar mass fractions at the image positions. Type Ia supernovae are of particular interest as knowledge of the intrinsic source brightness helps constrain the amount of (de)magnification from the macromodel predictions that might be due to microlensing. In addition, the presence or absence of caustic crossings in the light curves of glSNe can be used to constrain the mass of the microlenses. We find that a sample of 50 well-modeled glSNe Ia systems with single epoch observations at peak intrinsic supernova luminosity should be able to constrain a stellar mass-to-light ratio to within $\sim 15\%$. A set of systems with light curve level information providing the location (or absence) of caustic crossing events can also constrain the mass of the microlenses to within $\sim 50\%$. Much work is needed to make such a measurement in practice, but our results demonstrate the feasibility of microlensing to place constraints on astrophysical parameters related to the initial mass function of lensing galaxies without any prior assumptions on the stellar mass.
#### Can the neutrinos from TXS 0506+056 have a coronal origin?

 - **Abstract**
 The blazar TXS 0506+056 has been the first astrophysical source associated with high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, and it has emerged as the second-most-prominent hotspot in the neutrino sky over ten years of observations. Although neutrino production in blazars has traditionally been attributed to processes in the powerful relativistic jet, the observation of a significant neutrino flux from NGC 1068 -- presumably coming from the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) corona -- suggests that neutrinos can also be produced in the cores of AGN. This raises the question whether neutrino production in TXS~0506+056 is also associated with the core region. We study this scenario, focusing on the hypothesis that this blazar is a masquerading BL Lac, a high-excitation quasar with hidden broad emission lines and a standard accretion disk. We show that magnetic reconnection is an acceleration process necessary to reach tens of PeV proton energies, and we use observationally motivated estimates of the X-ray luminosity of the coronal region to predict the emission of secondaries and compare them to the observed multi-wavelength and neutrino spectra of the source. We find that the coronal neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056 is too low to describe the IceCube observed neutrinos from this AGN, which in turn suggests that the blazar jet remains the preferred location for neutrino production.
#### The radio re-brightening of the Type IIb SN 2001ig

 - **Abstract**
 We study the late-time evolution of the compact Type IIb SN 2001ig in the spiral galaxy NGC 7424, with new and unpublished archival data from the Australia Telescope Compact Array and the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder. More than two decades after the SN explosion, its radio luminosity is showing a substantial re-brightening: it is now two orders of magnitude brighter than expected from the standard model of a shock expanding into a uniform circumstellar wind (i.e., with a density scaling as R^{-2}). This suggests that the SN ejecta have reached a denser shell, perhaps compressed by the fast wind of the Wolf-Rayet progenitor or expelled centuries before the final stellar collapse. We model the system parameters (circumstellar density profile, shock velocity, mass loss rate), finding that the denser layer was encountered when the shock reached a distance of ~0.1 pc; the mass-loss rate of the progenitor immediately before the explosion was Mdot/v_w ~ 10^{-7} Msun/yr/(km/s). We compare SN 2001ig with other SNe that have shown late-time re-brightenings, and highlight the opposite behaviour of some extended Type IIb SNe which show instead a late-time flux cut-off.
#### The $Hubble$ Missing Globular Cluster Survey. I. Survey overview and the first precise age estimate for ESO452-11 and 2MASS-GC01

 - **Abstract**
 We present the $Hubble$ Missing Globular Cluster Survey (MGCS), a $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$ treasury programme dedicated to the observation of all the kinematically confirmed Milky Way globular clusters that missed previous $Hubble$ imaging. After introducing the aims of the programme and describing its target clusters, we showcase the first results of the survey. These are related to two clusters, one located at the edge of the Milky Way Bulge and observed in optical bands, namely ESO452-11, and one located in the Galactic Disc observed in the near-IR, namely 2MASS-GC01. For both clusters, the deep colour-magnitude diagrams obtained from the MGCS observations reach several magnitudes below their main-sequence turn-off, and thus enable the first precise estimate of their age. By using the methods developed within the CARMA project, we find ESO452-11 to be an old, metal-intermediate globular cluster, with ${\rm [M/H]}\simeq-0.80^{+0.08}_{-0.11}$ and an age of ${\rm t}=13.59^{+0.48}_{-0.69}$ Gyr. Its location on the age-metallicity relation makes it consistent with an in-situ origin, in agreement with its dynamical properties. On the other hand, the results for 2MASS-GC01 highlight it as a young, metal-intermediate cluster, with an age of ${\rm t}=7.22^{+0.93}_{-1.11}$ Gyr at ${\rm [M/H]}=-0.73^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$. This is the first ever age estimate for this extremely extincted cluster, and indicates it either as the youngest globular known to date, or as a massive and compact open cluster, which is consistent with its almost circular, disc-like orbit.
#### Constraining the geometry of the gas surrounding a typical galaxy at $z = 3.4$ with Ly$\alpha$ polarization

 - **Abstract**
 Ly$\alpha$ emission is the strongest tracer of recombining ionized hydrogen in young, star-forming galaxies, but its origin is still debated. Ly$\alpha$ arises when emitted photons scatter in neutral hydrogen and, so far, observational efforts have mostly focused on the Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness and spectral profile, which depend on the neutral hydrogen column density, geometry, kinematics, powering mechanism and on the region from which the photons are emitted. Different processes produce similar spectra, but have different degrees of polarization, that we can use to discriminate between them. In this paper, we present the first spectropolarimetric observations of a typical star-forming galaxy at $z\sim 3.4$, strongly lensed by the cluster of galaxies Abell 2895, taken with the PMOS mode of the VLT/FORS2 instrument. We measure a Ly$\alpha$ degree of polarization $1\sigma$ upper limit of $4.6\%$. We develop new Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer models to reproduce the observations, that can be explained by assuming the star-forming galaxy being embedded in a CGM with a biconical outflow geometry, with an opening angle of the wind $\theta_{o,Wind}\sim 30^\circ$ for line-of-sight angles $\theta_{LOS} \leq 20^\circ$, $\theta_{o,Wind}\sim 45^\circ$ for $\theta_{LOS}\leq 20^\circ$, $\theta_{o,Wind}\sim 60^\circ$ for $\theta_{LOS}\leq 20^\circ$, and $\theta_{o,Wind}\sim 75^\circ$ for $\theta_{LOS}\leq 40^\circ$, where $\theta_{LOS}=0^\circ$ means observing in the direction of the outflow. We notice that the constraints from polarization are complementary to those from the spectral line profile. This study shows the potential of adding measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ degree of polarization to constrain the geometry of the gas surrounding typical star-forming galaxies and paves the way to spatially resolved studies that will allow us to disentangle between different Ly$\alpha$ origin mechanisms.
#### Cosmic Ray Feedback in Massive Halos: Implications for the Distribution of Baryons

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01753

 - **Abstract**
 We use order of magnitude estimates and observational constraints to argue that feedback from relativistic cosmic rays (CRs) produced by massive black holes is likely to have a particularly large effect at radii of order the virial radius and larger in group-mass halos. We show that for a range of plausible (but uncertain) CR transport parameters and energetics, the pressure produced by CRs generated by the central massive black hole over its lifetime can be of order the thermal gas pressure in the outskirts of $\sim 10^{13-14} M_\odot$ halos (but not in more massive clusters). The properties of this CR feedback at low redshift are not well predicted by the radiative cooling rate of hot gas at smaller radii, which is often used as a proxy for `current' black hole feedback. This is because most black hole growth happens early in massive halos, and CR transport timescales in halo outskirts are Gyr or more; the accumulated CR energy thus depends on the full history of black hole activity in the halo. The large CR pressure in group-mass systems likely leads to CR-driven outflows that move gas from large halo radii to outside the virial radius. Such feedback would not be captured by current cosmological simulations that focus on mechanical black hole feedback; in particular, CR feedback remains active even long after the mechanical feedback sourcing the CRs has turned off. We speculate that this CR feedback may be important for explaining the weak lensing $S_8$ tension and the evidence for strong feedback at large halo radii from kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich measurements. Prospects for testing this mechanism observationally and implementing the necessary physics in cosmological simulations are discussed.
#### Tracking the Chemical Evolution of Hydrocarbons Through Carbon Grain Supply in Protoplanetary Disks

 - **Abstract**
 The gas present in planet-forming disks typically exhibits strong emission features of abundant carbon and oxygen molecular carriers. In some instances, protoplanetary disks show an elevated C/O ratio above interstellar values, which leads to a rich hydrocarbon chemistry evidenced in the mid-infrared spectra. The origin of this strengthened C/O ratio may stem from the release of less complex hydrocarbons from the chemical processing of carbonaceous grains. We have explored a set of 42 single-cell models in which we match the physical conditions to the inner regions of planet-forming disks, while varying the C/O ratio by exploring different levels of CH$_4$, C, H$_2$O, and CO to the gas-phase chemistry, which we evaluate in both the cosmic/X-ray and UV-driven limit. We find that the carbon-bearing species in our models exhibit high dependencies on the driver of the chemistry, where both CO and long chain hydrocarbons act as carbon sinks in the cosmic/X-ray-driven chemistry limit, while the vast majority ends up in atomic carbon and CO in the UV-driven limit. We also find moderate dependencies upon the C/O ratio, where this and the ionization rate/UV field determines the point of peak production of a species as well as its equilibrium abundance. We also find that the production of several hydrocarbons, specifically C$_2$H$_2$, is strongly dependent up to an order of magnitude on the initial water abundance. We lastly find that in the X-ray-driven limit, both CH$_4$ and C serve as highly transient donor species to the carbon chemistry.
#### Coronal energy release by MHD avalanches III. Identification of a reconnection outflow from a nanoflare

 - **Abstract**
 Outflows perpendicular to the guide field are believed to be a possible signature of magnetic reconnection in the solar corona and specifically a way to detect the occurrence of ubiquitous small-angle magnetic reconnection. The aim of this work is to identify possible diagnostic techniques of such outflows in hot coronal loops with SDO/AIA and the forthcoming MUltislit Solar Explorer (MUSE), in a realistically dynamic coronal loop environment in which an MHD avalanche is occurring. We consider a 3D MHD model of two magnetic flux tubes, including a stratified, radiative and thermal-conducting atmosphere, twisted by footpoint rotation. The faster rotating flux tube becomes kink-unstable and soon involves the other one in the avalanche. The turbulent decay of this magnetic structure on a global scale leads to the formation, fragmentation, and dissipation of current sheets driving impulsive heating akin to a nanoflare storm. We captured a clear outflow from a reconnection episode soon after the initial avalanche and synthesized its emission as detectable with AIA and MUSE. The outflow has a maximum temperature around 8 MK, a total energy of 1024 erg, a velocity of a few hundred km/s, and a duration of less than 1 min. We show the emission in the AIA 94 A channel (Fe XVIII line) and in the MUSE 108 A Fe XIX spectral line. his outflow shares many features with nanojets recently detected at lower temperatures. Its low emission measure makes, however, its detection difficult with AIA, but Doppler shifts can be measured with MUSE. Conditions become different in a later steady state phase when the flux tubes are filled with denser and relatively cooler plasma.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are a key component of galaxy evolution due to feedback on the host from its supermassive black hole. The morphology of warm, in- and outflowing dusty material can reveal the nature of the onset of feedback, AGN feeding, and the unified model of AGN. Here we use the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) to image the dense, obscuring disk and extended dusty outflow region of NGC 1068. In Fizeau imaging mode the LBTI synthesizes the equivalent resolution of a 22.8 m telescope. The 8.7 $\mu$m Fizeau images of NGC 1068 {have an effective resolution of $47\times90$ mas ($3.3\times6.2$ pc)} in a 5" field of view after performing PSF deconvolution techniques described here. This is the only extragalactic source to be Fizeau imaged using the LBTI, and the images bridge the scales measured with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI; 0.5-5 pc) and those of single telescopes such as JWST and Keck ($>15$ pc). The images detect and spatially resolve the low surface brightness mid-infrared (MIR) features in the AGN disk/wind region that are over-resolved by the VLTI. The images show strong correlation between MIR dust emission and near-infrared (NIR) emission of highly excited atomic lines observed by SINFONI. Such LBTI imaging is a precursor to infrared imaging using the upcoming generation of extremely large telescopes, with angular resolutions up to 6x better than JWST, the largest space telescope in orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 We model continuous gravitational wave (CW) sources detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), using the ASTRID cosmological simulation. The most detectable single sources are in the low-frequency bins and are produced by the most supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers (with M_BH ~ 10^10 - 10^11 solarmass) in the most massive galaxies M_star ~ 10^12 solarmass. Remarkably, these mergers (mostly at z< 0.3) occur within massive galaxies residing at the center of galaxy clusters. Particularly striking in ASTRID is a triple merger event, where two subsequent mergers in the same cluster core generate high-detection-probability CW signals at ~ 2nHz and ~ 10nHz. We expect electromagnetic signatures from these events: either single or dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) and massive host galaxies that are undergoing significant star formation. We establish a novel connection between these high-mass, central cluster mergers, occurring in galaxies with active star formation and AGN, and the formation process of the central cluster galaxy in ASTRID. This provides new insights into the low-frequency gravitational wave sky and informs future multi-messenger searches for PTA CW sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Since its launch, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer-02 (AMS-02) has delivered outstanding quality measurements of the spectra of cosmic-ray (CR) species, $e^{\pm}$, $\bar{p}$, and nuclei (H-Si, S, Fe), which have resulted in a number of breakthroughs. Besides elemental spectra, AMS-02 also measures the spectra of light isotopes albeit within a smaller rigidity range. In this paper, we use the precise measurements of He isotopes and the $^3$He/$^4$He ratio by AMS-02, together with Voyager 1 data, and investigate their origin. We show that there is an excess in $^3$He at higher energies compared to standard calculations assuming its fully secondary origin, which may indicate a source of primary $^3$He, or signify a change in the propagation parameters over the Galactic volume probed by the $^3$He/$^4$He ratio. We provide updated local interstellar spectra (LIS) of $^3$He and $^4$He in the rigidity range from 2-40 GV. Our calculations employ the self-consistent GalProp-HelMod framework that has proved to be a reliable tool in deriving the LIS of CR $e^{-}$, $\bar{p}$, and nuclei $Z\le28$.
#### Turbulent gas-rich discs at high redshift: origin of thick stellar discs through 3D 'baryon sloshing'

 - **Abstract**
 In response to recent observations from JWST and ALMA, we explore a new class of dynamically self-consistent models using our AGAMA/Ramses hydrodynamic N-body framework (Nexus) that mimics a plausible progenitor of the Milky Way over a wide range of disc gas fractions ($f_{\rm gas} = 0-100\%$). The high gas surface densities encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas to drive turbulence. We show that this coupling through momentum recoil drives 'baryon sloshing,' i.e. a random walk of the baryonic potential minimum with respect to the centre of the total gravitational potential, $\Phi_{\rm tot}$. The amplitude of the bulk motion depends on the strength of the feedback, which in turn is directly associated with $f_{\rm gas}$. At its most extreme, when gas is the sole contributor to the disc potential ($f_{\rm gas}=100$%), the amplitude of the walk can reach up to $R\approx 5$ kpc and $\vert z\vert \approx 1$ kpc within $\Phi_{\rm tot}(R,\phi,z)$. Consistent with observations, the disc dominates over dark matter ($f_{\rm disc}\gtrsim 50$%) within $R_s=2.2 R_{\rm disc}$, where $R_{\rm disc}$ is the exponential disc scale length. For a lower $f_{\rm disc}$ and/or $f_{\rm gas}$, the 3D sloshing amplitude and velocity are reduced. The combination of strong feedback (which unbinds the disc) and sloshing leads to the newly formed stars being dynamically heated and settling to a more spatially extended disc population. The 3D heating process is isotropic but its effects are more noticeable in $\vert z\vert$ due to the initial dynamical coldness of the star-forming disc. Such a disc has enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe] stellar abundances and a vertical (but no radial) gradient in stellar age and metallicity, both consistent with the Milky Way's thick stellar disc. Contrary to earlier claims, star formation in a stationary turbulent disc does $not$ produce thick stellar discs.
#### Amplifying Resonant Repulsion with Inflated Young Planets, Overlooked Inner Planets, and Non-zero Initial $\Delta$

 - **Abstract**
 Most multi-planet systems around mature ($\sim 5$-Gyr-old) host stars are non-resonant. Even the near-resonant planet pairs still display 1-2\% positive deviation from perfect period commensurabilities ($\Delta$) near first-order mean motion resonances (MMR). Resonant repulsion due to eccentricity tides was one of the first mechanisms proposed to explain the observed positive $\Delta$. However, the inferred rates of tidal dissipation are often implausibly rapid (with a reduced tidal quality factor $Q_p^\prime \lesssim 10$). In this work, we attempt to amplify eccentricity tides with three previously ignored effects. 1) Planets tend to be inflated when they were younger. 2) Kepler-like Planets likely form as resonant chains parked at the disk inner edge, overlooked inner planets could have contributed to tidal dissipation of the whole system. 3) Disk migration captures planets into first-order MMR with non-zero initial deviation $\Delta$, thereby lowering the amount of dissipation needed. We show that even after accounting for all three effects, $Q_p^\prime$ can only be amplified by about one order of magnitude, and still falls short of $Q_p^\prime$ values of Solar System planets. Therefore, eccentricity tides alone cannot fully explain the observed $\Delta$ distribution. Other effects such as obliquity tides, planetesimal scattering, expanding disk inner edge, disk turbulence, divergent encounters, and dynamical instabilities must have contributed to dislodging planets from first-order MMR.

 - **Abstract**
 Dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with comparable masses are commonly witnessed among the major merged galaxies with interaction remnants. Considering almost every massive galaxy is associated with multiple dwarf satellites around it, minor mergers involving galaxies with disproportional stellar masses should be much more common than major mergers, which would naturally lead to black hole (BH) pairs with significantly different masses. However, dual AGNs generated by minor mergers involving one or two dwarf galaxies are exceptionally rare and understudied. Moreover, good estimates of the masses of both BHs are not yet available to test this idea. Here we report the evidence of a dual AGN candidate with mass ratio $\sim$7:1 located in an undisturbed disk galaxy. We identify the central BH with mass of $9.4 \times 10^6M_\odot$ from its radio emission as well as AGN-driven galactic-scale biconical outflows. The off-centered BH generates obvious broad and narrow emission-line regions, which gives us a robust estimation of a $1.3 \times 10^6M_\odot$ BH mass. We explore alternative scenarios for explaining the observational features of this system, including the complex gas kinematics triggered by central AGN activity and dust attenuation of the broad-line region of the central BH, finding that they failed to fully account for the kinematics of both the redshifted off-centered broad and narrow emission-line components.

 - **Abstract**
 Shocks in relativistically hot plasmas are thought to exist in various high-energy astrophysical phenomena, but it is not clear how relativistic collisionless shocks are formed, whether particles are accelerated by the shock as in the case of cold upstream. In this work, collisionless shocks with a relativistic shock velocity in relativistically hot unmagnetized electron-positron plasmas are investigated by two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. It is shown that the upstream flow is dissipated by the Weibel instability, so that the relativistic collisionless shock is formed as in the case of cold upstream. The density and magnetic field structures around the shock front are almost independent of the upstream temperature when the spatial scale is normalized by the inertial length scale which takes into account the relativistic temperature. This can be understood by considering the pressure anisotropy, which asymptotically approaches a finite value due to the relativistic beaming effect, even as the temperature becomes relativistically hotter and hotter. In addition, as long as the shock velocity is relativistic, some particles are accelerated, forming a power-law energy spectrum similar to that in the cold upstream.

 - **Abstract**
 A resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulation with a dynamo term is performed for modeling the collapsar in full general relativity. As an initial condition, a spinning black hole and infalling stellar matter are modeled based on a stellar evolution result, superimposing a weak toroidal magnetic field. After the growth of a massive torus around the black hole, the magnetic field is amplified in it, developing poloidal fields via dynamo. In an early stage of the torus growth, magnetic fluxes that fall to the vicinity of the central black hole are swallowed by the black hole and global poloidal magnetic fields that can be the source of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism are not developed. However, in a later stage in which the ram pressure of the infalling matter becomes weak, the magnetic field amplified by the black hole spin via the winding becomes large enough to expel the infalling matter by the magnetic pressure, and subsequently, a global poloidal magnetic field that penetrates the black hole is established, launching a jet along the spin axis by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism with the luminosity suitable for explaining typical long gamma-ray bursts. Together with the jet launch, the effectively viscous effect in the inner region of the torus and the magnetocentrifugal effect drive the stellar explosion with the explosion energy comparable to typical or powerful supernovae. We also find large amounts of synthesized $^{56}$Ni and Zn associated with the stellar explosion. In the presence of jet launching, $r$-process elements are weakly synthesized. The numerical results of the explosion energy, ejecta mass, and $^{56}$Ni mass are in a good agreement with those for observed broad-lined type Ic supernovae. Our result illustrates a self-consistent scenario for the gamma-ray-burst-associated broad-lined type Ic supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of chemical elements in the star-forming regions can store information on the chemical enrichment history of the galaxies. Negative metallicity gradients are expected in galaxies forming inside-out. However, observations show that the metallicity profiles can be broken. We aim to study the diversity of metallicity profiles that can arise in the current cosmological context and compare them with available observations. We also seek to identify the physical processes responsible for breaks in metallicity profiles by using two galaxies as case studies. We analyze central galaxies from the cosmological simulations of the CIELO project, within the stellar mass range [$10^{8.5}$, $10^{10.5}$] M$_\odot$ at $z=0$. A new algorithm, DB-A, was developed to fit multiple power laws to the metallicity profiles, enabling a flexible assessment of metallicity gradients in various galactic regions. The simulations include detailed modeling of gas, metal-dependent cooling, star formation, and supernova feedback. At $z=0$, we find diverse profile shapes, including inner and outer drops and rises, with some galaxies exhibiting double breaks. Gradient values align with observations. A temporal analysis of Local Group analogs shows inner and outer breaks occurring at all cosmic times, with outer breaks being more frequent. Metallicity gradients show high variability at high redshift, transitioning to mild evolution at lower redshift. Most inner breaks show central oxygen enhancement, linked to gas accretion and star formation. Inner drops result from disrupted gas due to feedback-driven outflows. Outer breaks with high metallicities arise from re-accreted material, extended star formation, and CGM-driven gas mixing. Outer drops are common at high redshift, linked to metal-poor gas accretion from cold flows. We highlight the complex interplay of these processes which often act together.

 - **Abstract**
 The first SRG/eROSITA all-sky X-ray survey, eRASS1, resulted in a catalogue of over twelve thousand optically-confirmed galaxy groups and clusters in the western Galactic hemisphere. Using the eROSITA images of these objects, we measure and study their morphological properties, including their concentration, central density and slope, ellipticity, power ratios, photon asymmetry, centroid shift and Gini coefficient. We also introduce new forward-modelled parameters which take account of the instrument point spread function (PSF), which are slosh, which measures how asymmetric the surface brightness distribution is, and multipole magnitudes, which are analogues to power ratios. Using simulations, we find some non forward-modelled parameters are strongly biased due to PSF and data quality. For the same clusters, we find similar values of concentration and central density compared to results by ourselves using Chandra and previous results from XMM-Newton. The population as a whole has log concentrations which are typically around 0.3 dex larger than South Pole Telescope or Planck-selected samples and the deeper eFEDS sample. The exposure time, detection likelihood threshold, extension likelihood threshold and number of counts affect the concentration distribution, but generally not enough to reduce the concentration to match the other samples. The concentration of clusters in the survey strongly affects whether they are detected as a function of redshift and luminosity. We introduce a combined disturbance score based on a Gaussian mixture model fit to several of the parameters. For brighter clusters, around 1/4 of objects are classified as disturbed using this score, which may be due to our sensitivity to concentrated objects.

 - **Abstract**
 In tomographic weak lensing surveys, the presence of nulling properties reveals symmetries inherent in the data, which rely solely on the geometrical properties of the Universe. Ensuring its validity thus provides us with constraints on the cosmological parameters that describe the background evolution, particularly the redshift dependence of the cosmological angular distance. This forms the basis of the tomographic cosmic shear nulling test that we introduce here. We outline how such a test can be executed, what it can constrain, and its specific efficiency in constraining cosmological parameters. Additionally, we explore its sensitivity to astrophysical effects such as magnification bias and reduced shear corrections, as well as observational systematics like errors in the mean redshift of the source bins. Our findings indicate that in a scenario akin to that of Euclid, this nulling test can bring significant and complementary constraints on basic cosmological parameters such as $\{\Omega_m,{\rm w}_0\}$, provided that the mean redshift of the bins are known at a level of $10^{-3}$. We conclude that the combination of nulling as a cosmological probe or a consistence test with usual weak lensing and galaxy clustering probes could allow to better keep systematics under control and bring more precise results in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 The enigmatic phenomenon of dark energy (DE) is regarded as the elusive entity driving the accelerated expansion of our Universe. A plausible candidate for DE is the non-zero Einstein Cosmological Constant $\Lambda_{E}$ manifested as a constant energy density of the vacuum, yet it seemingly defies gravitational effects. In this work, we interpret the non-zero $\Lambda_{E}$ through the lens of scale-invariant cosmology. We revisit the conformal scale factor $\lambda$ and its defining equations within the Scale-Invariant Vacuum (SIV) paradigm. Furthermore, we address the profound problem of the missing mass across galactic and extragalactic scales by deriving an MOND-like relation, $g \sim \sqrt{a_0\,g_N}$, within the SIV context. Remarkably, the values obtained for $\Lambda_{E}$ and the MOND fundamental acceleration, $a_0$, align with observed magnitudes, specifically, $a_0 \approx 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \, \mathrm{s}^{-2}$ and $\Lambda_{E} \approx 1.8 \times 10^{-52} \, \mathrm{m}^{-2}$. Moreover, we propose a novel early dark energy term, $\tilde{T}_{\mu\nu} \sim \kappa H$, within the SIV paradigm, which holds potential relevance for addressing the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 Surface convection is important for the presence of magnetic activity at stars. So far, this convection is thought to be a result of heating from below, where convection cells rise and break up. New models reveal that surface convection is instead strongly driven by cooling from above. We compare two simulations of surface convection, one with a significant heating from below and one without. We obtain surface convection in both cases, and they show similar granulation patterns. The deep convection driven by heating from below is still evolving and asymptotically approaches a steady-state solution. We find that convection from below is not needed at all to form typical photospheric granulation. This indicates the possibility of a surface dynamo acting on stars without a convecting envelope. Even stars without a convecting envelope could therefore exhibit stronger magnetic and coronal activity than expected so far.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars are extremely stable natural timekeepers. Pulsar Timing Array experiments, tracking subtle changes in the pulsars' rotation periods, can shed light on the presence of ultralight particles in our Galaxy. In this conference paper, we start by reviewing the most conservative scenario, in which ultralight particles interact only gravitationally. In this setting, we show that Pulsar Timing Arrays are able to constrain the presence of ultralight fields up to a few tenths of the observed dark matter abundance. Then, we consider conformally coupled ultralight candidates, demonstrating that the constraints on the universal scalar coupling of the field to Standard Model particles improve on existing bounds by several orders of magnitude, in the relevant mass range analyzed by Pulsar Timing Arrays. The discussion presented here is based on [1,2].

 - **Abstract**
 We use the CN/CO intensity ratio to obtain the dense gas fraction, $f_{\text{dense}}$, for a sample of 16 Ultra-luminous and Luminous Infrared Galaxies and compare $f_{\text{dense}}$ with a suite of global galaxy properties. We find a significant correlation between $f_{\text{dense}}$ and star formation rate calculated using both infrared luminosities and radio continuum, although there is significant scatter in each relation. We find no trend between global or peak $f_{\text{dense}}$ and merger stage. We find no correlation between global $f_{\text{dense}}$ and X-ray luminosity; however, the correlation becomes significant when we measure $f_{\text{dense}}$ at the location of peak X-ray emission. Our interpretation is that the dense gas is co-localized with strong X-ray emission from an active galactic nuclei or strong central star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The next generation of gravitational wave detectors and electromagnetic telescopes are beckoning the onset of the multi-messenger era and the exciting science that lies ahead. Multi-messenger strong gravitational lensing will help probe some of the most important questions of the Universe in an unprecedented manner. In particular, understanding the nature of gravitational wave sources, the underlying physical processes and mechanisms that produce emissions well before or right until the time of the merger, their associations to the seemingly distinct populations of gamma ray bursts, fast radio bursts and kilonovae. Not to mention, multi-messenger lensing will offer unique probes of test of gravity models and constraints on cosmological parameters complementary to other probes. Enabling multi-messenger science calls for concerted follow-up efforts and development of new and shared resources required in the community.
#### 2D Surface Brightness Modelling of Large 2MASS Galaxies II: The Role of Classical Bulges and Pseudobulges on Galaxy Scaling Relations and its implication for Supermassive Black Hole Formation

 - **Abstract**
 We have generated 2D-multicomponent surface brightness (SB) modelling for 100 galaxies in the Large Galaxy Atlas (LGA) together with 19 nearby cD galaxies using the near-infrared (NIR) images from 2MASS (J, H and Ks ). Our final sample of 119 galaxies includes cD galaxies, Virgo cluster galaxies, group galaxies, and field galaxies, but 68 % are spiral galaxies. We revisit known scaling relations (SRs) involving structure parameters, as well as those involving supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and ultramassive black holes (UMBHs). Refining the SRs, we revisited the classification of bulges. In this study, we have considered the Fundamental Plane (FP) and its projections, as well as other SRs, such as the colour-magnitude relation (CMR), the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) and the luminosity-concentration relation (LCR). Classical bulges follow the same relations as elliptical galaxies, while pseudobulges are usually outliers. The NIR colours of classical bulges and pseudobulges indicate that their ages are not radically different despite their spread in luminosity, but we noticed that classical bulges are more luminous than pseudobulges; therefore, this property provides a complementary bulge/pseudobulge classification criterion. We have included pseudobulges from other studies to strengthen our sample's tendencies seen for pseudobulges in our sample. We also revised the SRs for SMBHs and UMBHs, finding that pseudobulges do not follow SRs for early-type galaxies and classical bulges. In addition, the lack of correlation between BHs and discs may indicate these structures have not coevolved. From the revision of SRs, we present a sample of galaxies likely to host SMBHs or UMBHs, which are suitable for dynamical BH mass determination accessible from the ground.
#### Short-Term Balmer Line Emission Variability in M Dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 M Dwarfs make up the majority of stars, offering an avenue for discovering exoplanets due to their smaller sizes. However, their magnetic activity poses challenges for exoplanet detection, characterization, and planetary habitability. Understanding its magnetic activity, including surface starspots and internal dynamos, is crucial for exoplanet research. In this study, we present short-term variability in four Balmer emission lines \ha, \hb, \hg, and \hd\ for a sample of 77 M dwarfs of varying spectral types, and binarity. Stars were observed using the MDM Observatory's Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph on the 2.4m Telescope and the Modular Spectrograph on the 1.3 m Telescope. These data are combined with TESS photometry to explore the connection between spectroscopic and photometric variability. We observe sporadic short-term variability in Balmer lines for some stars, on timescale $\gtrsim$ 15-min, but much shorter than the stellar rotation period. We calculate periods for stars lacking those measurements, re-evaluated the relationship between amplitude (\rvar)-activity relation for the \ha \ line from \citet{garcia_soto_contemporaneous_2023}, and extended our analysis to the \hb, \hg \ and \hd \ lines, which indicates that the relation becomes increasingly dispersed for higher-order Balmer lines. This is consistent with increased intrinsic variability from lower to higher order lines. Additionally, we compute the Balmer decrement, using \hb \ as the fiducial, for stars where we could measure \hg \ and/or \hd. The Balmer decrement can show distinct patterns during white-light flares, with significant differences even for the same star. We also find evidence for dark spots on \object{TIC 283866910}.
#### New perspective on the multiple population phenomenon in Galactic globular clusters from a wide-field photometric survey

 - **Abstract**
 Wide-field photometry of Galactic globular clusters (GCs) has been investigated to overcome limitations from the small field of view of the Hubble Space Telescope in the study of multiple populations. In particular, 'chromosome maps' (ChMs) built with ground-based photometry were constructed to identify the first and second generation stars (1G and 2G) over the wide-field of view. The ChMs allow us to derive the fraction of distinct populations in an analyzed field of view. We present here the radial distribution of the 2G fraction in 29 GCs. The distributions show that all the GCs either have a flat distribution or more centrally concentrated 2G stars. Notably, we find that the fraction of 1G stars outside the half-light radius is clearly bifurcated across all mass range. It implies that a group of GCs with lower 1G fractions (hereafter Group II) have efficiently lost their 1G stars in the outermost cluster regions. In fact, in connection with the trends of the radial distribution, most GCs of Group II have spatially mixed populations, while only less massive GCs in Group I (a group with higher 1G fraction) show that feature. Lastly, we investigate links between these two groups and host cluster parameters. We find that most GCs of Group II are distributed along a broader range of galactocentric distances with smaller perigalactic distances < 3.5 kpc. Besides, by using the Gaia data, it is observed that Group II GCs have higher energy on the integrals of motion diagrams than Group I GCs.
