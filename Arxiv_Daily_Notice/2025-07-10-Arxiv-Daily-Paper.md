 - **Abstract**
 Using the MOPTOP polarimeter on the 2-meter Liverpool Telescope, we conducted a monitoring campaign targeting three optically-discovered TDEs (AT2024bgz, AT2024pvu, and AT2024wsd) and two Bowen flares in AGN (AT2020afhd and AT2019aalc). The three thermal TDEs showed low intrinsic polarization levels ($\Delta P \approx 0$-$6\%$) with stable polarization angles. The Bowen flares also showed variable polarization degree ($ \Delta P \approx 0$-$8\%$), but significant polarization angle variability: AT2020afhd exhibited a $\Delta \theta = 83 \pm 8 \,^\circ$ shift at 150 days post-optical peak, while the AT2019aalc displayed quasi-periodic swings of $\Delta \theta \approx 40 \, ^\circ$ amplitude starting 190 days after peak brightness. The TDEs of this study are well described by models invoking rapid disk formation and reprocessed emission from optically thick outflows, whereas the Bowen flares reveal more complex reprocessing geometries, potentially consistent with TDEs occurring in AGN gas-rich environments. We find that moderate polarization is observed at later times for TDEs with low-Eddington ratios and highly extended photospheres. This implies that, as the accretion level declines, we expect more asymmetric reprocessing layers along a given viewing angle. Since the outflow density and velocity depend sensitively on the inclination angle, we expect TDEs with low-Eddington ratios and highly extended photospheres to exhibit varying levels of polarization. The polarization of AT2019aalc (Seyfert 1) hints at a clumpy, asymmetric outflow and the presence of a tilted, precessing accretion disk, while the polarization of AT2020afhd (AGN type 2) is consistent with the detection of a scattered light echo.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic field is known to play a crucial role in star formation. Dust polarization is an effective tool for probing the morphology of the field, yet it does not directly trace its strength. Several methods have been developed, combining polarization and spectroscopic data, to estimate the strength of the magnetic field, including the DCF method, which relates these quantities to the magnetic-field strength under the assumption of Alfvénic turbulence. Skalidis & Tassis (2021) (ST), relaxed this assumption to account for the compressible modes, deriving more accurate estimates of the field strength. We evaluate the accuracy of these methods in star-forming regions and propose a systematic approach for calculating the key observational parameters involved: the velocity dispersion (dv), the dispersion of polarization angles (d\theta), and the cloud density (rho). We use a 3D MHD chemodynamical simulation of a turbulent molecular cloud and generate synthetic observations, for seven different inclination angles. We employ various approaches for estimating the parameters dv, d\theta, and rho and find that the approach used to calculate these parameters plays a crucial role in estimating the magnetic field strength. We show that the value probed by both the DCF and ST methods corresponds to the median of the molecular-species-weighted POS component of the magnetic field. The ST outperforms DCF, accurately following the expected cosine trend with respect to the inclination angle, and remains within 1\sigma from the true strength of the field. Based on our analysis, we proposed that, in self-gravitating clouds, the intrinsic parameters (rho, dv, d\theta) should be calculated as follows: rho using radiative transfer analysis, dv using the second moment maps, and d\theta by fitting Gaussians to the polarization angle distributions to remove the contribution of the hourglass morphology.

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric redshifts (photo-$z$'s) are crucial for the cosmology, galaxy evolution, and transient science drivers of next-generation imaging facilities like the Euclid Mission, the Rubin Observatory, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Previous work has shown that image-based deep learning photo-$z$ methods produce smaller scatter than photometry-based classical machine learning (ML) methods on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Main Galaxy Sample, a testbed photo-$z$ dataset. However, global assessments can obscure local trends. To explore this possibility, we used a self-organizing map (SOM) to cluster SDSS galaxies based on their $ugriz$ colors. Deep learning methods achieve lower photo-$z$ scatter than classical ML methods for all SOM cells. The fractional reduction in scatter is roughly constant across most of color space with the exception of the most bulge-dominated and reddest cells where it is smaller in magnitude. Interestingly, classical ML photo-$z$'s suffer from a significant color-dependent attenuation bias, where photo-$z$'s for galaxies within a SOM cell are systematically biased towards the cell's mean spectroscopic redshift and away from extreme values, which is not readily apparent when all objects are considered. In contrast, deep learning photo-$z$'s suffer from very little color-dependent attenuation bias. The increased attenuation bias for classical ML photo-$z$ methods is the primary reason why they exhibit larger scatter than deep learning methods. This difference can be explained by the deep learning methods weighting redshift information from the individual pixels of a galaxy image more optimally than integrated photometry.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce NewCluster, a new high-resolution cluster simulation designed to serve as the massive halo counterpart of the modern cosmological galaxy evolution framework. The zoom-in simulation targets a volume of $4.1\sigma$ overdensity region, which is expected to evolve into a galaxy cluster with a virial mass of $5 \times 10^{14} M_\odot$, comparable to that of the Virgo Cluster. The zoom-in volume extends out to 3.5 virial radii from the central halo. The novelties of NewCluster are found in its resolutions. Its stellar mass resolution of $2 \times 10^{4} M_\odot$ is effective for tracing the early assembly of massive galaxies as well as the formation of dwarf galaxies. The spatial resolution of 68 parsecs in the best-resolved regions in the adaptive-mesh-refinement approach is powerful to study the detailed kinematic structure of galaxies. The time interval between snapshots is also exceptionally short-15 Myr-which is ideal for monitoring changes in the physical properties of galaxies, particularly during their orbital motion within a larger halo. The simulation has up-to-date feedback schemes for supernovae and active galactic nuclei. The chemical evolution is calculated for ten elements, along with dust calculation that includes the formation, size change, and destruction. To overcome the limitations of the Eulerian approach used for gas dynamics in this study, we employ Monte Carlo-based tracer particles in NewCluster, enabling a wide range of scientific investigations.
#### Dating N loud AGNs at high redshift: GS3073 as a snapshot of wCen like evolution of a nuclear star cluster

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we address two major questions raised by recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of the young Universe, namely: 1) what are the seed initial masses, and how rapidly have supermassive black holes (BHs) with masses of 1e6-1e8Msun grown in active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosted by very young galaxies? 2) What are the plausible explanations for the super solar abundances of nitrogen in a fraction of young galaxies at high redshift, both with and without evidence of a massive central black hole? We focus mainly on the system GS3073. This system shows an exceptionally large log(N/O)=+0.42(+0.13/-0.10) in the gas close to the AGN. We show here that this abundance is consistent with the composition of gas ejected from massive asymptotic giant branch stars. Moreover, this system shows chemical properties matching those expected at a specific point of the evolution of the abundances in the extreme populations of the former nuclear star cluster wCentauri (wCen). This analogy, along with the N/O, C/O and Fe/O abundances in GS3073, lead to an estimate of an age range of 270-440 Myr for this object, much smaller than the redshift (z=5.5) age of about 1 Gyr. We also adopt the same criteria to estimate an age for GNz11. These two determinations constrain the BH mass versus age relation: accretion on the BH must proceed at intermittent superEddington rates in the first phases, and at a much lower rate after the first half gigayear of life of the Universe. The intermittency of accretion is also a fundamental requirement to allow the formation of the extreme (N rich, O depleted, He rich) populations today observed in wCen for a large range of metallicities.

 - **Abstract**
 Multimessenger astronomy seeks to uncover the origins of cosmic rays and neutrinos. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory plays a key role in monitoring the sky for revealing high energy neutrinos and neutrino time clusters possibly associated with astrophysical sources, issuing alerts to the astrophysical community for significant excesses. This enables joint observations with other astronomical facilities that could reveal the hidden mechanisms behind the most extreme environments in the Universe. In particular, since 2006 the Gamma-ray Follow-Up (GFU) program shares cluster alerts with partner Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes. The faint cosmic signals, searched against large atmospheric backgrounds, are widely masked by the statistical penalties that arise when scanning the full sky in an unbiased way. Hence, targeted analyses of pre-selected neutrino source candidates have proven to increase our search sensitivity. Our understanding of astrophysical environments has improved in recent years, with evidence of neutrino emission from the blazar TXS 0506+056 and the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. The aim of expanding observational possibilities and engaging the broader scientific community through public cluster alerts has motivated the creation of a new list of target sources to be monitored by IceCube. This contribution presents the systematic compilation of this list, which extends the well-established focus on gamma-ray bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) to include X-ray bright AGN and binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous and Ultra-luminous IR galaxies ((U)LIRGs) are critical for investigating feedback mechanisms due to a combination of intense star formation (SF) episodes and active galactic nuclei (AGN), particularly in the context of complex galaxy interactions. We conduct a detailed analysis of the II ZW 096 merging system using the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), combining high-resolution Narrow Field Mode (NFM) and large-area Wide Field Mode (WFM) observations. We mapped the morphology, kinematics, and ionizing radiation of the system's gas by fitting atomic emission lines and the optical continuum. We identify three or more distinct galaxies within II ZW 096, revealing rotational patterns and complex interactions consistent with a collapsing small galaxy group. The kinematics and ionization structures suggest high star formation rates and shock-driven processes, which align with this proposed scenario. Focusing on the D1 compact region, which contributes 40-70% of the system's IR emission, and combining information from archival multi-wavelength observations, we find strong evidence of a heavily obscured AGN powering it. Our analysis of the internal structure, interactions, and merger state of II ZW 096 offers novel insights into the galaxy evolution processes in this dynamic and highly chaotic system

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the nature and evolution of dark energy (DE) is a central challenge in modern cosmology. In this work, we explore the constraining power of bright standard sirens -- gravitational wave (GW) events with electromagnetic counterparts - for probing the DE equation of state as function of redshift. Focusing on future GW observations from next-generation ground-based GW detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, we perform a comprehensive analysis using simulated binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) events over five years of observation with a $75\%$ duty cycle. We consider three broad classes of DE models: (i) phenomenological parametrizations, specifically the Barboza-Alcaniz extension to the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder model; (ii) physically motivated scalar field scenarios, specifically hilltop quintessence; and (iii) evolving dark matter setup in which the matter density evolves as $(1+z)^{3+\alpha}$. For each case, we jointly infer the Hubble constant $H_0$ and model-specific DE parameters from the observed GW luminosity distances and spectroscopic redshifts. Our results demonstrate that bright sirens alone can yield competitive and independent constraints on the time evolution of DE indicating that multi-messenger cosmology has the potential to test a wide range of DE theories, bridging phenomenological and physically motivated models, and paving the way for precision cosmology in the era of GW astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying galaxy evolution requires knowledge not only of the stellar properties, but also of the interstellar medium (in particular the molecular phase) out of which stars form, using a statistically significant and unbiased sample of galaxies. To this end, we introduce here the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution (iEDGE), a collection of integrated stellar and nebular emission lines, and molecular gas properties from 643 galaxies in the local Universe. These galaxies are drawn from the CALIFA datasets, and are followed up in CO lines by the APEX, CARMA, and ACA telescopes. As this database is assembled from data coming from a heterogeneous set of telescopes (including IFU optical data and single-dish and interferometric CO data), we adopted a series of techniques (tapering, spatial and spectral smoothing, and aperture correction) to homogenise the data. Due to the application of these techniques, the database contains measurements from the inner regions of the galaxies and for the full galaxy extent. We used the database to study the fundamental star formation relationships between star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass ($M_*$), and molecular gas mass ($M_{\rm mol}$) across galaxies with different morphologies. We observed that the diagrams defined by these quantities are bi-modal, with early-type passive objects well separated from spiral star-forming galaxies. Additionally, while the molecular gas fraction ($f_{\rm mol}=M_{\rm mol}/M_*$) decreases homogeneously across these two types of galaxies, the star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/$M_{\rm mol}$) in the inner regions of passive galaxies is almost two orders of magnitude lower compared to the global values. This indicates that inside-out quenching requires not only low $f_{\rm mol}$, but also strongly reduced SFE in the galactic centres.
#### AXES-SDSS: Solving the puzzle of X-ray emission of optical galaxy groups via a modified Hausdorff distance

 - **Abstract**
 The identification of X-ray and CMB sources as galaxy groups and clusters is a prerequisite for cluster cosmology. But the identification of groups, especially nearby ones, suffers from projection effects which in turn affect the purity of the sample. In X-rays, the position of the cluster can be given either by the peak of the emission, or by the full information content of the cluster image. Similarly, the optical center, or its member galaxies, can describe the optical counterpart. With the progress of numerical simulations, it is currently feasible to reproduce both the optical group membership assignment and the behavior of the group outskirts in X-rays, and therefore there is an opportunity to define a reproducible group identification procedure. We performed two-way matching between X-ray contours, drawn at a fixed surface brightness level corresponding to a baryonic overdensity of ~500, to the projected galaxy positions using a modified Hausdorff distance (MHD). We used the volume-limited SDSS group catalog to evaluate the purity and completeness of the procedure, maintaining the constant performance of the optical group finder with redshift. We find that an MHD of 0.631 Mpc provides 90% purity. This is a clear improvement over the methods that rely on the optical counterparts' distance and richness. We study the purity versus MHD and the completeness versus redshift and velocity dispersion. Over half of nearby groups have X-ray emission, even those with velocity dispersions as low as 200km/s; this has never previously been demonstrated. The bulk of these groups follow the same scaling relations as the groups with a small separation between the optical and X-ray centers, removing feedback as an explanation for the lack of matches in previous studies. Instead, the problem is caused by over-merging in the optical group catalog construction and source confusion in X-rays.
#### The EDGE-CALIFA survey: Star formation relationships for galaxies at different stages of their evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy evolution is largely driven by star formation activity or by the cessation of it, also called star formation quenching. In this paper, we present star formation scaling relations for galaxies at different evolutionary stages. To do so, we used the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution (iEDGE), which collects CO, optical continuum, and emission line information for 643 galaxies from the CALIFA IFU dataset. By considering the patterns described by star-forming and retired regions, we grouped the galaxies into quenching stages using the emission line classification scheme, QueStNA. We observed that the molecular gas mass ($M_{\rm mol}$) decreases from star-forming to retired systems and so does the molecular-to-stellar mass ratio ($f_{\rm mol}$). In contrast, star formation efficiency (SFE) is constant in the quenching stages dominated by star formation and rapidly declines afterwards. We observed that this rapid decline is more pronounced in the centre of the galaxies compared to the rest of the discs, reflecting the inside-out quenching displayed by nearby galaxies. We noticed that the relations between $M_{\rm mol}$ and the stellar mass ($M_*$) become increasingly shallow with the quenching stages; however, the relations between the star formation rate (SFR) and $M_{\rm mol}$ steepen when going from star-forming to retired systems. We observed that a three-dimensional relation between SFR, $M_*$, and $M_{\rm mol}$ exists for star-forming galaxies, while data points from other quenching groups are scattered across the parameter space. Taken together, these pieces of evidence indicate that the quenching of the galaxies cannot be explained solely by a depletion of the molecular gas and that a significant decrease in the SFE is necessary to retire the centre of the galaxies beyond the star formation green valley.
#### Optically Overluminous Tidal Disruption Events: Outflow Properties and Implications for Extremely Relativistic Disruptions

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that tidal disruption events (TDEs) with off-axis jets may manifest as optically overluminous events. To search for jet signatures at late times, we conducted radio observations of eight such optically overluminous ($M_{g, \rm peak} < -20.8$ mag) TDEs with the Very Large Array. We detect radio counterparts in four events. The observed radio luminosities ($L_{\rm 6 GHz} \sim 10^{38}$--$10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$) are two orders of magnitude lower than those of on-axis jetted TDEs, and we find no evidence for off-axis jets within rest-frame time of 3 yrs. Two of them (AT2022hvp and AT2021aeou) exhibit evolving radio emission, consistent with synchrotron emission from non-relativistic outflows launched near the time of first optical light. Two events (AT2020ysg and AT2020qhs) show no statistically significant variability, which can be attributed to either non-relativistic outflows or pre-existing active galactic nuclei. Compared to a control sample of fainter TDEs with $M_{g, \rm peak} > -20.5$ mag observed at similar rest-frame timescales ($t_{\rm rest} ~ 1.5$\,yr), our sample shows systematically more luminous radio emission, suggesting that optically overluminous TDEs may launch more powerful prompt non-relativistic outflows. We speculate that strong general relativistic effects near high-mass black holes ($M_{\rm BH} ~ 10^8\,M_\odot$) may play a key role. These findings motivate further investigation into the nature of relativistic disruptions around massive black holes and the physical conditions necessary for jet formation.
#### Blowing Star Formation Away in AGN Hosts (BAH) -- IV. Serendipitous discovery of a $z\sim2.9$ star-forming galaxy lensed by the galactic bulge of CGCG\:012-070 using JWST NIRSpec

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of a gravitationally lensed galaxy by the nearby spiral galaxy CGCG 012-070 ($z = 0.048$) using Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The lensed galaxy is identified through the flux distributions of emission lines in the rest-frame optical, consistent with a source located at a redshift of $z\sim2.89$. The system is detected in [O III]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, H$\beta$, and H$\alpha$ emission lines, exhibiting line ratios typical of a star-forming galaxy. The emission-line flux distributions reveal three distinct components, which are modeled using an elliptical power-law (EPL) mass profile for the lens galaxy. This model provides a good characterization of the source and reveals a disturbed star-forming morphology consistent with those of galaxies at cosmic noon.

 - **Abstract**
 The radio emission of cosmic-ray air-showers changes significantly depending on parameters like signal frequency, magnetic field configuration and observing altitude. We use CoREAS simulations to adapt an existing signal model for the radio emission of inclined showers in the 30-80 MHz frequency band to the wide 50-200 MHz band. Our model uses a parametrisation of the charge excess fraction to isolate the geomagnetic emission component. We reconstruct the geomagnetic radiation energy by fitting a lateral distribution function, provided by the model, to the geomagnetic energy fluence distribution of the shower. After we correct for the shower geometry and air density, we correlate the radiation energy with the electromagnetic energy of the shower. We show that the method intrinsic energy resolutions < 5% for the sites of the Pierre Auger Observatory and GRANDProto300. For GRANDProto300, we test the reconstruction with simulations of a realistic, sparse antenna grid and with added noise, and find an energy resolution of < 10% with negligible bias. We do a similar study for a much larger array of 10, 000 km2 with 1 km antenna spacing. We find an intrinsic energy resolution of < 10%.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy quenching, the intricate process through which galaxies transition from active star-forming states to retired ones, remains a complex phenomenon that requires further investigation. This study investigates the role of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in regulating star formation by analyzing a sample of 643 nearby galaxies with redshifts between 0.005 and 0.03 from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey. Galaxies were classified according to the Quenching Stages and Nuclear Activity (QueStNA) scheme, which categorizes them based on their quenching stage and the presence of nuclear activity. We further utilized the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution (iEDGE), which combined homogenized optical integral field unit and CO observations. This allowed us to examine how AGNs influence the molecular gas reservoirs of active galaxies compared to their non-active counterparts at similar evolutionary stages. Our Kolmogorov-Smirnov and chi-squared tests indicate that the star formation property distributions and scaling relations of AGN hosts are largely consistent with those of non-active galaxies. However, AGN hosts exhibit systematically higher molecular gas masses across all quenching stages except for the quiescent nuclear ring stage. We find that AGN hosts follow the expected trends of non-active quenching galaxies, characterized by a lower star formation efficiency and molecular gas fraction compared to star-forming galaxies. Our results suggest that signatures of instantaneous AGN feedback are not prominent in the global molecular gas and star formation properties of galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipsing, short-period post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs) have been studied for several decades by eclipse timing variations (ETVs) which have been interpreted as being caused by circumbinary bodies. In this paper we report 355 new observations of 7 PECBs (HS0705+6700, NN Ser, NSVS 07826147, NSVS 14256825, NY Vir, QS Vir and RR Cae) and examine how the recent proposed models of these systems compare with our new observations. We find that none of the 18 recent models fit accurately with our data. We review alternative mechanisms of the ETVs, including magnetic effects, but conclude that they do not predict our results. Although we cannot exclude the presence of circumbinary bodies a combination of several mechanisms may be required to explain the observed ETVs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an efficient and accurate algorithm for solving the Poisson equation in spherical polar coordinates with a logarithmic radial grid and open boundary conditions. The method employs a divide-and-conquer strategy, decomposing the computational domain into hierarchical units with varying cell sizes. James's algorithm is used to compute the zero-boundary potentials of lower-level units, which are systematically integrated to reconstruct the zero-boundary potential over the entire domain. These calculations are performed efficiently via matrix-vector operations using various precomputed kernel matrices. The open-boundary potential is then obtained by applying a discrete Green's function to the effective screening density induced at the domain boundaries. The overall algorithm achieves a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N^3 \log N)$, where $N$ denotes the number of cells in one dimension. We implement the solver in the FARGO3D magnetohydrodynamics code and demonstrate its performance and second-order accuracy through a series of test problems.

 Context. Deriving the mass and large-scale asymmetries of radioactive isotopes offers valuable insights into the complex phases of a supernova explosion. Important examples are $^{56}$Ni, with its decay products $^{56}$Co and $^{56}$Fe, and $^{44}$Ti, which are studied through their X-rays emission lines and provide a powerful diagnostic tool to probe the explosive nucleosynthesis processes in the inner layers of the exploding star. Aims. In this framework, SN 1987A provides a privileged laboratory being the youngest supernova remnant from which the mass of Ti has been estimated. However, some tension exists in determining the initial mass of $^{44}$Ti. Previous analysis, relying on \textit{NuSTAR} and \textit{INTEGRAL} data, report $M_{44} = (1.5 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-4}$ $M_\odot$ and $M_{44}=(3.1 \pm 0.8) \times 10^{-4} M_\odot$, respectively. In this paper we estimate the initial mass of $^{44}$Ti via its decay product, the $^{44}$Sc emission line at 4.09 keV, using \textit{Chandra} observations. Methods. We perform multi-epoch spectral analysis focusing on the inner part of the remnant, to minimize the contamination from the X-ray emission stemming from the shocked plasma. As a result, we provide the detection of $^{44}$Sc emission line in the central part of SN 1987A with a $\sim$99.7\% (3 $\sigma$) significance. Results. The simultaneous fit of the spectra extracted from observations between 2016 and 2021 provides a line flux of $6.8^{+2.2}_{-2.3}\times 10^{-7}$ photons s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ corresponding to a $^{44}$Ti mass $M_{44}=(1.6\pm0.5) \times 10^{-4} M_\odot$ (errors at the $90\%$ confidence level). The results obtained with our spectral analysis seem to align with those derived with NuSTAR.

 - **Abstract**
 While cosmic voids are now recognized as a valuable cosmological probe, identifying them in a galaxy catalog is challenging for multiple reasons: observational effects such as holes in the mask or magnitude selection hinder the detection process; galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution; and it is non-trivial to estimate the detection significance and parameter uncertainties for individual voids. Our goal is to extract a catalog of voids from constrained simulations of the large-scale structure that are consistent with the observed galaxy positions, effectively representing statistically independent realizations of the probability distribution of the cosmic web. This allows us to carry out a full Bayesian analysis of the structures emerging in the Universe. We use 50 posterior realizations of the large-scale structure in the Manticore-Local suite, obtained from the 2M++ galaxies. Running the VIDE void finder on each realization, we extract 50 independent void catalogs. We perform a posterior clustering analysis to identify high-significance voids at the 5$\sigma$ level, and we assess the probability distribution of their properties. We produce a catalog of 100 voids with high statistical significance, available at this https URL, including the probability distributions of the centers and radii of the voids. We characterize the morphology of these regions, effectively producing a template for density environments that can be used in astrophysical applications such as galaxy evolution studies. While providing the community with a detailed catalog of voids in the nearby Universe, this work also constitutes an approach to identifying cosmic voids from galaxy surveys that allows us to account rigorously for the observational systematics intrinsic to direct detection, and provide a Bayesian characterization of their properties.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube has detected a diffuse flux of high-energy neutrinos, whose origin still remains uncertain. Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been proposed as plausible sources of neutrinos. Candidate sources include AT2019dsg, which is likely a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), and AT2019dfr, an AGN flare. Both present delayed emission in the IR band with respect to the optical signal. This emission can be interpreted as the reprocessing of X-rays to optical light of the flare by dust located in a torus around the SMBH. An additional study using an optically detected sample of 63 accretion flares revealed another candidate as a potential high-energy neutrino counterpart: AT2019aalc, which is also accompanied by a dust echo. However, follow-up stacking analysis of the 63 nuclear flares using the full IceCube data sample did not show any significant excess over background. Motivated by these three suggested neutrino-TDE correlations, we analyze a more extensive catalog of IR flares, 823 dust-echo-like flares identified using WISE satellite data, against the IceCube 10-year sample of track events from the Northern Sky. Our analysis aims to perform sensitivity studies and assess the potential detectability of neutrino emission from these types of accretion flares. In addition, we carry out a correlation study of the 823 dust echo-like flares against a revised catalog of IceCube high-purity astrophysical alerts, and reevaluate the previous study of 63 nuclear flares against the same revised alerts sample.

 - **Abstract**
 Observing the stars in our night sky tells us that giant, supergiant and hypergiant stars hold an unique importance in the understanding of stellar populations. Theoretical stellar models predict a rich tapestry of evolved stars. These evolved stars result in supernova explosions for massive stars and the shedding of the outer layers of low- and intermediate-mass stars to form white dwarf stars. Stars on these pathways provide elemental and kinematic feedback that shapes their host galaxies and synthesize the elements that we observe in the Universe today. Observational surveys in the Milky Way and the Local Group of galaxies shape our physical understanding of stellar evolution. Hypergiant stars represent stellar evolution at the extremes, displaying evidence of intense stellar winds combined with luminosities and radii that are unrivalled. Supergiant stars are used as elemental beacons in distant galaxies, and supergiants that cross the Cepheid variable instability strip can be used as rulers to measure the scale of our Universe. The overwhelming majority of stars in the Milky Way will become giant stars. Giants are hundreds of times larger and thousands of times more luminous than the Sun, which makes them excellent tracers of stellar structure. In this chapter, I describe the observational and theoretical manifestations of stellar evolution at various stages and masses. I highlight evolutionary connections between evolved products and comment on their eventual endpoints.
#### Investigating the CREDIT history of supernova remnants as cosmic-ray sources

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) have long been suspected to be the primary sources of Galactic cosmic rays. Over the past decades, great strides have been made in the modelling of particle acceleration, magnetic field amplification, and escape from SNRs. Yet while many SNRs have been observed in nonthermal emission in radio, X-rays, and gamma rays, there is no evidence for any individual object contributing to the locally observed flux. Here, we propose a particular spectral signature from individual remnants that is due to the energy-dependent escape from SNRs. For young and nearby sources, we predict fluxes enhanced by tens of percent in narrow rigidity intervals; given the percent-level flux uncertainties of contemporary cosmic-ray data, such features should be readily detectable. We model the spatial and temporal distribution of sources and the resulting distribution of fluxes with a Monte Carlo approach. The decision tree that we have trained on simulated data is able to discriminate with very high significance between the null hypothesis of a smooth distribution of sources and the scenario with a stochastic distribution of individual sources. We suggest that this cosmic-ray energy-dependent injection time (CREDIT) scenario be considered in experimental searches to identify individual SNRs as cosmic-ray sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae are of particular interest in multi-messenger astronomy due to their potential to accelerate cosmic rays and produce high-energy neutrinos. One such supernova is the recent SN2023ixf located in M101 (the Pinwheel Galaxy). It is the closest (6.4 Mpc) and brightest (B band magnitude 10.8) core-collapse supernova in nearly a decade. This supernova likely had a progenitor surrounded by dense circumstellar material which, during the supernova, may have produced neutrinos when ejecta collided with the material. I will present results of a follow-up of this supernova using data collected from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory located at the South Pole. We obtain results consistent with background expectations with time-integrated energy flux ($E^2 dN/dE$) upper limits of 0.35 GeV/cm$^2$ for a 32-day time window and 0.44 GeV/cm$^2$ for a 4-day time window, both at 90% confidence level for an $E^{-2}$ power law. These correspond to values of $2.7 \times 10^{48}$ erg for the 32-day time window and $3.5 \times 10^{48}$ erg for the 4-day time window at the supernova.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray-bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been one of the most promising source classes of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. The first evidence of an IceCube point source was a blazar detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), TXS ~0506+056. Previous analyses have ruled out GeV-bright blazars as the predominant contributor to the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux under simple correlation assumptions about the relationship between the fluxes of gamma rays and neutrinos. We present results from a more general and more sensitive search for correlation between neutrinos and GeV-selected AGN using improvements in the IceCube statistical methods and 13 years of data. We detect no correlation and set stringent constraints on neutrino emission by populations of GeV-detected AGN. These include constraints on the neutrino emission from subclasses of GeV-detected AGN, including BL Lacs, flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) and non-blazar AGN, using stacking analyses testing a variety of hypothesized relationships between neutrino and gamma-ray flux. We also present results from an analysis that is sensitive to a wider range of relationships between the gamma-ray and neutrino signal.
