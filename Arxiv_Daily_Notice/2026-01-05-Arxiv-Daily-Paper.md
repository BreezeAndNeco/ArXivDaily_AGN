#### Born in the Dark: The Catastrophic Collapse of Fuzzy Dark Matter Solitons as the Origin of Little Red Dots

 - **Abstract**
 JWST surveys have uncovered a population of compact, red sources ("Little Red Dots," LRDs) at $z \ge 5$ that exhibit broad Balmer emission yet remain X-ray faint, implying heavy obscuration with $N_H \ge 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. We propose that LRDs may trace a short-lived, obscured phase associated with rapid baryonic inflow inside the deep solitonic cores of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos. Combining the soliton size scaling with (i) the observed compact radii ($r_e \sim 30-100$ pc) and (ii) the requirement that Compton-thick columns be achievable within a region of order the core radius, we find that particle masses $m$ few $\times 10^{-22}$ eV are plausible for soliton masses $M_s \sim 10^8 - 10^9 M_\odot$; we adopt $m_{22}=2$ as a fiducial choice. A conservative mass-budget estimate for the obscuring column, together with isothermal hydrostatic stratification, indicates that configurations reaching $N_H \ge 10^{24} - 10^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$ require densities for which radiative losses (cooling and/or diffusion) occur faster than the dynamical time, suggesting that a long-lived static hot atmosphere is unlikely (an "Opacity Crisis") and that rapid inflow or radiation-pressure-driven evolution is favored. Using $512^3$ pseudo-spectral Schrödinger-Poisson simulations of idealized soliton mergers, we illustrate that compact, high-density soliton cores can form via violent relaxation under representative scalings. We discuss observational implications and tests, and outline the need for future radiation-hydrodynamic modeling to predict demographics and detailed spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid proliferation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has introduced a new class of radio frequency interference (RFI) that poses a fundamental challenge to modern radio astronomy. In particular, unintended electromagnetic radiation emitted by satellite electronics exhibits strong temporal variability and weak spectral regularity, limiting the effectiveness of conventional mitigation techniques that rely on long term averaging or multi epoch observations. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits of low rank interference mitigation in the single epoch regime, where only a single time frequency snapshot is available. We formulate satellite induced interference as a structured but non stationary component superposed on astrophysical signals and thermal noise, and analyze the conditions under which low rank decomposition can successfully suppress interference while preserving underlying astronomical information. Through controlled simulations and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that aggressive rank truncation can lead to substantial signal distortion, particularly for diffuse or low signal to noise astrophysical features. We quantify this trade off using preservation and suppression metrics, and show that beyond a critical interference strength, low rank methods inevitably induce irreversible information loss. Our results clarify the operational boundaries of low rank approaches for next generation radio observations and highlight the need for interference aware, data driven mitigation strategies tailored to the single epoch regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Red supergiants (RSGs) are important for our understanding of supernova progenitors, stellar populations, stellar evolution, mass loss and dust production. Extragalactic surveys of RSGs have a long history in the Local Group, but few studies exist beyond that due to the limited resolution and sensitivity of ground-based and previous space-based infrared observatories. Here we demonstrate the combined power of HST and JWST to push systematic searches of RSGs out to $\sim$20 Mpc. We introduce a catalog of 97057 RSGs -- the largest single-survey release of RSGs -- with masses $\gtrsim$10 M$_{\odot}$ in 19 galaxies from the PHANGS HST+JWST Treasury program. We use HST F814W and JWST F200W photometry to select stars as RSGs based on predicted colors and magnitudes from PARSEC isochrones. The spatial distribution of our recovered RSGs follow the familiar pattern of mostly being concentrated in active star-forming regions such as spiral arms and central starburst rings. The RSG number density on kpc-scales is strongly correlated ($r_s$$\sim$0.82) with local star-formation rate density ($\Sigma_{SFR}$) traced by extinction-corrected far-ultraviolet (FUV) from GALEX+WISE, and weakly correlated ($r_s$$\sim$0.57) with the total stellar mass density ($\Sigma_*$), traced by near-infrared emission from WISE+Spitzer. The number of RSGs per mass of stellar populations with ages 6-30 Myr (the likely age range of RSGs $>$10 M$_{\odot}$) is $\sim$1 per 10$^{3.77\pm0.27}$ M$_{\odot}$, assuming constant star-formation rates from FUV+W4. Our sample will be a useful resource for tracking progenitors and feedback sites of future supernovae in PHANGS, age-dating stellar populations, and more.
#### Sub-Neptune Memories I: Implications of Inefficient Mantle Cooling and Silicate Rain

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the evolution of sub-Neptune (radii between $\sim$1.5 and 4 R$_\oplus$) exoplanet interior structures using our upgraded planetary evolution code, \texttt{APPLE}, which self-consistently couples the thermal and compositional evolution of the whole structure. We incorporate stably stratified regions with convective mixing and, for the first time, ab initio results on the phase separation of silicate-hydrogen mixtures to model silicate rain in sub-Neptune envelopes. We demonstrate that inefficient mantle cooling can retain sufficient heat to Gyr ages: inefficient heat transport from mantle to envelope alone keeps radii $\sim$10\% larger than predicted by adiabatic models at late times. Silicate rain can contribute an additional $\sim$5\% to the radius, depending on envelope mass and initial metal abundance. The silicate-hydrogen immiscibility region may lie in the middle or even upper envelope, far above the envelope-mantle boundary layer, and bifurcates the envelope into two an upper, hydrogen-rich region and a lower, metal-rich region above the mantle. If silicate rain occurs, atmospheres should appear depleted of silicates while radii remain inflated at late ages. To demonstrate this, we present interior evolution models for GJ 1214 b, K2-18 b, TOI-270 d, and TOI-1801 b, showing that hot, liquid silicate mantles with thin envelopes reproduce their radii and mean densities, providing an alternative to water-world interpretations. These results imply that bulk compositions inferred from mean density must account for mantle thermal state and envelope mixing/phase separation history; such thermal ``memories'' may constrain formation entropies and temperatures when metallicities are better measured.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of four young open clusters, NGC 663, NGC 2301, NGC 2384, and NGC 7510, utilizing high-precision astrometric and photometric data from Gaia DR3. Cluster membership was determined using the UPMASK algorithm, resulting in probable member counts ranging from 337 to 1498 across the clusters. Bayesian MCMC isochrone fitting yielded cluster ages in the range $\log t \sim 7.0$ -$8.15$, with uncertainties of $\sim 0.11$-$0.18$. Reddening values ranged from $E(B-V)=0.093$ mag in NGC 2301 to $1.24$ mag in NGC 7510, consistent with their positions near the Galactic plane. The stellar mass function slopes ($\alpha \approx 2.00$-$2.26$) closely match the Salpeter IMF, with total stellar masses spanning nearly an order of magnitude, from $\sim 486\,M_\odot$ in NGC 2301 to $\sim 3584\,M_\odot$ in NGC 663. Dynamical relaxation times indicate that only NGC 2301 ($\tau \approx 10.00$) and NGC 2384b ($\tau \approx 2.03$) are dynamically relaxed; the others remain dynamically evolving. Orbital integrations in the MWPotential2014 model reveal nearly circular Galactic orbits with very low eccentricities ($e \approx 0.003$-$0.014$) and small vertical distances ($Z_{\rm max} < 0.142$ kpc), confirming their confinement to the thin disk. SED and kinematic analysis show that NGC 2384a and NGC 2384b are separated by $\sim 0.55$ kpc, indicating an optical pair.

 - **Abstract**
 Once carbon--oxygen white dwarfs cool sufficiently, they crystallize from the inside out. If the white dwarf is rich enough in ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}$, these crystallized solids are buoyant and rapidly rise, efficiently liberating potential energy which may halt the cooling of the white dwarf or power magnetic phenomena. Although this ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}$ distillation process may explain the cooling anomaly in Q-branch white dwarfs and anomalous emission lines in DAHe white dwarfs, its operation demands unusually high ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}$ abundances not generically predicted by isolated stellar evolution. We show that the engulfments of helium white dwarfs by both main-sequence and red giant stars can result in carbon--oxygen white dwarfs with ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}$ abundances high enough to distill ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}$. This enhancement occurs because carbon dredged up following an especially energetic and off-center helium flash can be processed into ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}$ by subsequent hydrogen shell burning and helium shell burning. ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}$-distilling white dwarfs from these merger channels are predicted to be somewhat more massive than typical white dwarfs (up to $\simeq0.7M_\odot$) and may have anomalous rotation rates, consistent with DAHe white dwarfs. These binary formation channels for ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}$-rich white dwarfs reveal new connections between binary interactions and white dwarf cooling phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 Long gamma-ray bursts (lGRB) are produced by relativistic jets arising from the collapse of massive stars. Such progenitor environments present complex physical conditions that are challenging to model by numerical simulations. The difficulty increases when solving the accretion process and propagation of the outflows, as it requires covering distances from the black hole horizon to beyond the progenitor star. General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations provide a convenient framework to study high-luminosity jets, where magnetic flux plays an important role in the process of jet launching from the central engine. To follow the propagation of the jet through and beyond its progenitor environment, we use multi-scale simulations (i.e., AMR-based). In this work, we report results of 2.5-dimensional GRMHD simulations of a lGRB progenitor. We present highly magnetized, weakly magnetized, and non-magnetized pre-collapse stars, and discuss the observational implications for lGRB jets.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the launch of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in late 2021, our understanding of high-redshift objects has faced several upheavals. JWST has discovered much more massive galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBH) than cosmological models had expected. Furthermore, JWST observations have revealed an entirely novel population of high-redshift objects. Characterized by a dominant red rest-frame component and point-like morphology, these ``little red dots'' (LRD) have set off a flurry of observational and theoretical follow-up. The current identity of LRD is highly debated, yet falling into two main scenarios: active galactic nuclei (i.e., SMBH) or compact star-forming regions. If star-forming, LRD would represent the highest stellar densities ever observed. If SMBH, their high Eddington fractions, and already high masses, help elucidate the growth of the most massive SMBH found by JWST in the early Universe ($z \gtrsim4)$. In this mini-review, we present the observational evidence accumulated to date, including sub-millimeter probes of LRD dust masses, constraints on radio and X-ray emission from stacking, and rest-frame ultraviolet \& optical measurements provided by JWST. Furthermore, we highlight how identifying additional LRD that are truly primarily SMBH-driven may help to shed light on the formation of `overly massive' SMBH discovered by JWST within the first billion years since the Big Bang.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we demonstrate how Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can be used to combine different galaxy imaging datasets to improve redshift estimation with CNN models for cosmology. LoRA is an established technique for large language models that adds adapter networks to adjust model weights and biases to efficiently fine-tune large base models without retraining. We train a base model using a photometric redshift ground truth dataset, which contains broad galaxy types but is less accurate. We then fine-tune using LoRA on a spectroscopic redshift ground truth dataset. These redshifts are more accurate but limited to bright galaxies and take orders of magnitude more time to obtain, so are less available for large surveys. Ideally, the combination of the two datasets would yield more accurate models that generalize well. The LoRA model performs better than a traditional transfer learning method, with $\sim2.5\times$ less bias and $\sim$2.2$\times$ less scatter. Retraining the model on a combined dataset yields a model that generalizes better than LoRA but at a cost of greater computation time. Our work shows that LoRA is useful for fine-tuning regression models in astrophysics by providing a middle ground between full retraining and no retraining. LoRA shows potential in allowing us to leverage existing pretrained astrophysical models, especially for data sparse tasks.

 - **Abstract**
 Temporal asymmetry in the flux variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) offers key insights into the physical mechanisms driving AGN variability. In this study, we investigated the variability of the torus by analyzing temporal asymmetry in the mid-infrared (MIR) continuum. We compared ensemble structure functions between the brightening and dimming phases for AGNs at $0.15<z<0.4$, using monitoring data in the optical from the Zwicky Transient Facility and in the MIR from the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We found that AGNs with bluer optical-to-MIR colors exhibit positive temporal asymmetry in the MIR, indicating that their variability amplitude is larger when brightening. Conversely, those with redder colors show negative asymmetry, exhibiting larger variability amplitude when decaying. However, there is no significant temporal asymmetry in the $g$-band variability driven by the accretion disk, suggesting that the temporal asymmetry in the MIR continuum primarily originates from intrinsic processes in the torus instead of the reflection of the ultraviolet-optical variability from the accretion disk. Analysis of the composite light curves revealed that AGNs with bluer optical-to-MIR colors tend to brighten gradually in the MIR, leading to the observed temporal asymmetry. This finding suggests that hot-dust-rich AGNs evolve with a gradual decline in hot dust emission, while hot-dust-poor AGNs are associated with a steady increase.
#### Molecular hydrogen controls the temperatures of flares on TRAPPIST-1

 - **Abstract**
 Early JWST observations of TRAPPIST-1 have revealed an unexpected puzzle: energetic white-light flares ($\rm{E} > 10^{30}$ erg) reach temperatures of only ${\sim}$3500--4000\,K, nearly three times cooler than typical solar flares, which peak around 9000--10000\,K. Here we explain this difference by identifying the physical mechanism that regulates flare temperatures on late M-dwarfs. The key factor is that in the cool, dense atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1, magnetic heating is strongly moderated by the dissociation of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) into atomic hydrogen. This "H$_2$ dissociation thermostat" acts as an efficient energy sink, preventing flare regions from heating above ${\sim}4000$\,K. Our chemical equilibrium and heat capacity calculations show that this effect depends sensitively on stellar atmospheric pressure and the local abundance of H$_2$. In hotter stars, from early M dwarfs to solar-type stars, the scarcity of molecular hydrogen renders this mechanism ineffective; instead, atomic hydrogen ionization limits flare temperatures near ${\sim}$9000\,K.

 - **Abstract**
 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images of the supermassive black hole M87* depict an asymmetric ring of emission. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models of M87* and its accretion disk predict that the amplitude and location of the ring's peak brightness asymmetry should fluctuate due to turbulence in the source plasma. We compare the observed distribution of brightness asymmetry amplitudes to the simulated distribution in GRMHD models, across varying black hole spin $a_{*}$. We show that, for strongly magnetized (MAD) models, three epochs of EHT data marginally disfavor $|a_{*}| \lesssim 0.2$. This is consistent with the Blandford-Znajek model for M87's jet, which predicts that M87* should have nonzero spin. We show quantitatively how future observations could improve spin constraints, and discuss how improved spin constraints could distinguish between differing jet-launching mechanisms and black hole growth scenarios.
#### The Persistent Thermal Anomalies in Rocky Worlds

 - **Abstract**
 Observing the dayside thermal emissions of rocky exoplanets provides essential insights into their compositions and the presence of atmospheres. Even though no conclusive evidence has been found for atmospheres on small rocky exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs, recent JWST observations identified puzzling thermal emission excesses: some rocky exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs have dayside emission temperatures higher than the theoretical maximum. Theoretical maximum temperatures assume stellar irradiation as the sole energy source, implying that these planets may have internal heat sources. In this work, we simulate three possible planetary internal processes that may generate excessive heat in addition to stellar irradiation: residual heating from formation, tidal heating, and induction heating due to interactions with the stellar magnetic field. We found that these mechanisms, even when combined, cannot explain the observed thermal emission excesses, nor can they explain a tentative positive trend in the brightness temperature scaling factor as a function of irradiation temperature. Our results imply that planetary internal processes are unlikely to generate remotely detectable heat, so the observed thermal excesses, if astrophysical, are likely caused by stellar contamination, surface processes, or other internal processes not considered in this study. The ongoing JWST-HST Rocky Worlds Director's Discretionary Time Program and the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will provide more insights into the thermal emission of rocky exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a UV absorption-line analysis of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of Sextans B, a dwarf irregular galaxy at 1.3 Mpc distance on the outer frontier of the Local Group. Using HST/COS spectroscopy of two AGN sightlines passing through the Sextans B CGM at small impact parameters of 4 kpc and 8 kpc (0.04 and 0.08 r_vir), we detect the CGM in Si II, Si III, Si IV, and C II absorption. All four ions show a column-density profile that declines with radius. The profiles fall below the average CGM profiles of other nearby dwarfs (by 0.3-0.6 dex, depending on ion), likely due to the low halo mass and low metallicity of Sextans B. Using Cloudy photoionization models and interferometric measurements of the H I column density, we find low gas-phase silicon and carbon abundances in the Sextans B CGM, [Si/H]=-1.7+/-0.2 and [C/H]=-2.1+/-0.2, among the lowest gas-phase abundances anywhere in the Local Group. We calculate a cool CGM gas mass within 8 kpc of $\sim8\times10^8 M_\odot$, making the CGM the dominant baryon reservoir of the galaxy, ~20 times larger than both the H I mass and the stellar mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Common-envelope evolution (CEE) is among the most uncertain phases in binary evolution. To empirically constrain CEE, we construct a uniformly selected sample of eclipsing post--common-envelope binaries (PCEBs). Starting from an unresolved white dwarf-main-sequence (WDMS) candidate sample within 200 pc selected from the Gaia color-magnitude diagram, we identify 39 detached eclipsing WDMS binaries using ZTF light curves. The binaries contain cool M dwarfs orbiting warm white dwarfs with orbital periods ($P_{\rm orb}$) of 0.1-2 d. The sample's simple selection function allows us to model observational incompleteness and infer intrinsic properties of the PCEB population. We find an orbital-period distribution consistent with being log-uniform over 0.1-2 d, contrary to recent reports of a bimodal distribution. The companion-mass distribution peaks around $0.25~{\rm M_\odot}$ and declines steeply toward larger masses. The estimated local space density is $7.2\times10^{-5}~{\rm pc^{-3}}$, corresponding to a Galaxy-wide birth rate of 0.01 per year. Combining our results with recent Gaia-based constraints on wider WDMS binaries, we construct an empirical period distribution of post-interaction WDMS binaries spanning 0.1-1000 d. The emerging period distribution is roughly log-flat (d$N/{\rm d}\log P_{\rm orb}\propto P_{\rm orb}^0$) at $P_{\rm orb} < 2$ d and log-increasing (d$N/{\rm d}\log P_{\rm orb}\propto P_{\rm orb}^1$) at $P_{\rm orb} = 100-1000$ d. The 10-100 d regime remains poorly constrained, but a few nearby systems suggest it is also well-populated. Short-period PCEBs ($P_{\rm orb}<2$ d) with M dwarf companions are roughly 2-3 times more common than wide ($P_{\rm orb} = 100-1000$ d) WDMS binaries with FGK companions, which likely formed through stable mass transfer. These results provide direct observational constraints on CEE and an empirical benchmark for binary-population models.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetar flares are highly energetic and rare events where intense high-energy emission is released from strongly magnetised neutron stars. Fast radio bursts are short and intense pulses of coherent radio emission. Their large dispersion measures support an extragalactic origin. While their exact origin still remains elusive, a substantial number of models associates them with strong magnetic field and high-energy relativistic plasma found in the vicinity of magnetars. There is growing evidence that some fast radio bursts are associated to flare-type events from magnetars. We aim to provide a set of configurations describing a relativistic, spherical, mass-loaded, magnetic explosion. We proceed by solving the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, for a system that expands while maintaining its internal equilibrium. We employ a semi-analytical approach for the solution of the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. We assume self-similarity in time and radius, axial symmetry, and separation of variables. There exists a dichotomy of solutions that correspond to higher and lower density and thermal pressure compared to the external one. The ratio of the poloidal to toroidal field and the inclusion of pressure and mass density affect the expansion velocity. The classes of these solutions can be applied to magnetar giant flares and fast radio bursts. The ones corresponding to overdensities and higher pressure can be associated to magnetar flares, whereas the ones corresponding to underdensities can be relevant to fast radio bursts corresponding to magnetically dominated events with low mass loading.

 Assuming that Dark Matter is an ultralight scalar field which is coupled to electromagnetism via a gauge-kinetic function and which at the time of recombination is oscillating coherently over a Hubble patch, we show that there is a tachyonic instability for the gauge field modes which leads to the generation of magnetic fields on cosmological scales of sufficient amplitude to explain observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectroscopic characterization of 580 K dwarfs within 33 pc, observed with the CHIRON echelle spectrograph (R=80,000) on the SMARTS 1.5m telescope. This volume-limited sample is part of the RKSTAR survey of $\sim$4400 K dwarf primaries within 50 pc. Using Empirical SpecMatch and the diagnostic lines H-alpha (6562.8 Angstrom) and Li I (6707.8 Angstrom), we derive stellar properties, activity status, and age indicators calibrated against 35 benchmark K dwarfs with ages from 20 Myr to 5 Gyr. We find that 7.4% (43 stars) exhibit signatures of youth and/or chromospheric activity: 19 stars show lithium absorption indicating ages $<$1 Gyr, and 36 display H$\alpha$ emission. Kinematic analysis using BANYAN $\Sigma$ identifies 8 additional young stars through membership in the AB Doradus moving group and the Hyades cluster, bringing the total young/active population to 8.8% (51 stars). Stellar parameters span 3600--5500 K in \teff, $-$0.60 to $+$0.55 dex in [Fe/H], and $<$10 to $>$25 km s$^{-1}$ in $v\sin i$. A metal-poor population ([Fe/H] $\leq -$0.50 dex) comprises 4\% of the sample. Galactic kinematics place 80% in the thin disk and 18.4% in the thick disk, with one halo member (HD 134439). Young and active stars are predominantly thin disk members, with two thick disk exceptions. Cross-matching with NASA's Exoplanet Archive reveals only 7.5% (44 stars) host confirmed planets as of July 2025. Our results identify 529 mature, inactive K dwarfs as prime targets for terrestrial planet searches, providing a crucial resource for exoplanet habitability studies in the solar neighborhood.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent analyses conclude that Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star (HD 39801), likely has a companion object with a period of about 2000 days orbiting at only 2.3 stellar radii, deep in the chromosphere of the supergiant. A probable detection of such a companion, named Siwarha, has just occurred from speckle imaging. This study finds that Betelgeuse spectra in the optical region and ultraviolet exhibit signatures of variable circumstellar absorption and chromospheric outflows. These variations are consistent with the ~ 2000-day period of the companion object. Circumstellar absorption evident in optical Mn I lines, and mass outflow marked by ultraviolet Fe II, Si I, and Mg I lines increase after the transit of the companion across the disk of Betelgeuse. Following the eclipse of the companion, the absorption and outflow slowly decrease in advance of the next transit. The occurrence and variation of this plasma appear consistent with the presence of a trailing and expanding wake caused by a companion star orbiting within the atmosphere of Betelgeuse.

 - **Abstract**
 Our Sun is the closest X-ray astrophysical source to Earth. As such, it makes a formidable case study to better understand astrophysical processes. Solar flares are in particular very interesting as they are linked to coronal mass ejections as well as magnetic field reconnection sites in the solar atmosphere. Flares can therefore provide insightful information on the physical processes at play on their production sites, but also on the emission and acceleration of energetic charged particles towards our planet, making it a formidable forecasting tool for space weather. While solar flares are critical to understanding magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration, their hard X-ray polarization -- key to distinguishing between competing theoretical models -- remains poorly constrained by existing observations. To address this, we present the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP), a mission under development to perform solar flare polarimetry in the 25-100 keV energy range. CUSP consists of a 6U-XL platform hosting a dual-phase Compton polarimeter. The polarimeter is made of a central assembly of four 4x4 arrays of plastic scintillators, each coupled to multi-anode photomultiplier tubes, surrounded by four strips of eight elongated GAGG scintillator bars coupled to avalanche photodiodes. Both types of sensors from Hamamatsu are respectively read out by the MAROC-3A and SKIROC-2A ASICs from Weeroc. In this manuscript, we present the preliminary spectral performances of single plastic and GAGG channels measured in the laboratory using development boards of the ASICs foreseen for the flight model.

 - **Abstract**
 From the Eagle project, we study the properties of galaxies hosting AGN in cosmic voids and their surrounding structures, filaments and walls, at $z=0$, comparing them to non-AGN galaxies in similar environments. We found that the AGN fraction decreases as a function of void-centric distance, with void galaxies displaying the highest AGN fraction (12\%), and galaxies in denser environments, showing the lowest AGN fraction (6.7\%), consistent with observations. The AGN fraction is particularly high in most massive void galaxies when controlling for stellar mass. When comparing AGN host galaxies to inactive ones, we find that AGN galaxies tend to have slightly more massive SMBHs, higher specific star formation rates, and reside in higher-mass haloes at a given stellar mass than non-AGN galaxies. At $\rm M_{*} > \rm 10^{10.2} \rm M_{\odot}$, AGN hosts in voids tend to have slightly more massive SMBHs than those in denser environments. Otherwise, the AGN population does not show a clear trend in relation to the global environment. In contrast, non-AGN void galaxies host more massive SMBHs, slightly higher sSFRs, and are located in more massive haloes than those in denser environments. Analysing the recent merger histories of both AGN and non-AGN populations, we find that a larger fraction of massive AGN galaxies have undergone major mergers compared to non-AGN galaxies, regardless of environment. Notably, AGN galaxies in voids show a higher frequency of recent mergers, especially major mergers, than their counterparts in other environments, especially at high stellar mass. Our results suggest that the evolution of SMBHs in voids is closely related to that of their host galaxies and their surrounding environment, while the most recent AGN activity is more strongly linked to recent interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present a detailed asteroseismological analysis of WFST J053009.62+594557.0, a newly discovered faint pulsating white dwarf by the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) with a Gaia G magnitude of 19.13. Analysis of two nights of high-precision WFST g band photometry reveals three significant pulsation frequencies with high signal-to-noise ratios. Follow-up P200/DBSP spectroscopy classifies the object as a DA white dwarf with Teff=11,609 $\pm$ 605 K and M = 0.63$\pm$ 0.22 $M_{\odot}$. To probe its internal structure, we construct asteroseismological models with the White Dwarf Evolution Code (WDEC). After exploring sufficient matching models, best-fitting solutions yield Teff=11,850$\pm$ 10 K and M = 0.600 $\pm$ 0.005 $M_{\odot}$, consistent with independent constraints from Gaia color-magnitude diagram, Gaia XP spectrum, P200 spectral fitting, SED fitting, and Gaia parallax. It has shown that the asteroseismological distance agrees with the Gaia parallax to 1.45\%.
#### Activity correlation and temporal variation of small-scale magnetic fields on young Sun-like stars

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to evaluate how well the variation of small-scale magnetic fields on the stellar surface can be monitored with time-series observations. Further, we aim to establish to what extent the measured total unsigned magnetic field traces other activity indicators. We measured the total unsigned magnetic field on four young, stars using Zeeman splitting of magnetically sensitive spectral lines from high-resolution spectra obtained with the spectropolarimeters ESPaDOnS at CFHT and NARVAL at TBL. We then characterised the magnetic field variations using both sinusoidal variation and Lomb-Scargle periodograms. We evaluated how the rotational variation of the total unsigned magnetic field strength correlates with the activity indicators S-index, H$\alpha$-index, Ca IRT-index, and the large-scale magnetic field obtained from ZDI maps obtained in earlier studies. We find clear signals of rotational modulation of the total magnetic field on HIP 76768 and tentative detection on Mel 25-5. This is supported both by the sinusoidal fitting and the periodogram. For the other stars, we find no modulation signals of the total magnetic field. We find positive correlations between the total magnetic field and activity indices on all four stars, indicating that indirect magnetic activity indicators trace the underlying magnetic field variability. However, comparing the activity-magnetic field relationship between the stars in our sample shows a significant deviation between activity level and measured magnetic field strength. Small-scale magnetic field variability can be traced using the Zeeman effect on magnetically sensitive lines, provided that the star is sufficiently active. It is also possible to self-consistently recover rotational periods from such measurements. The primary limit for the detection of magnetic field variations is the precision of Zeeman broadening and intensification measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the gamma-ray spectrum in the MeV range arising from electron-positron pair annihilation in fireballs associated with magnetar giant flares (MGFs), motivated by the recent observation of a MeV gamma-ray line feature in a bright gamma-ray burst, GRB~221009A. We develop an analytic model of line emission, demonstrating that relativistic beaming results in a broadened, power-law spectral feature with photon index -1. We then perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations incorporating electron-positron pair production, annihilation, and Compton scattering. The dependence of the emergent spectrum on the baryon loading is also examined, showing that a baryon-poor fireball is more favorable for the detection of MeV gamma rays. We further assess the detectability of the line component. The simulation results indicate that a power-law MeV component from the initial spike of a Galactic MGFs could be observed with current instruments, such as Fermi/GBM, and will be well within the reach of upcoming MeV gamma-ray satellites, which are expected to detect O(100) photons from such events.

 - **Abstract**
 Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays are primarily estimated to arise from high-energy electromagnetic interactions in pulsars and their halo through electron inverse Compton (IC) scattering. Hadronic channels like neutral pion decay have also been proposed to produce TeV-PeV gamma rays from the Pulsar halo. The neutral pions are expected to be generated from cosmic ray (CR) protons interacting with the ambient/cloud. The recent observations of sub-PeV gamma rays from the halo of pulsar PSR J0622+3749 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory Kilometre-Square Array (LHAASO-KM2A) detector provide a platform to explore different channels of their production. Previous studies support consistency with the leptonic modeling of the halo, which attributes its origin to slow diffusion in the interstellar medium. In this work, we investigated the possibility of proton-proton channel as the origin of these photons. To explain the observed gamma rays with energy $\sim 4$ TeV by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) telescope till 200 TeV by the LHAASO observatory, one requires the CR proton luminosity to be $\eta_p\sim 0.1$ of the pulsar PSR J0622+3749 spin-down luminosity. In this case, we have considered the protons propagating in a one-zone superdiffusion environment, specifically $\alpha = 1$ in a cloud of gas density 1 per cm$^{3}$.
#### XRISM finds the Changing-Look AGN NGC 1365 in an extended low state: A dense, highly ionized outflow obscures the central source

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first XRISM/Resolve observations of the active galactic nucleus, NGC 1365, obtained in 2024 February and July. NGC 1365 is known for rapid transitions between Compton-thick and Compton-thin states, along with strong absorption from a highly ionized wind. During our observations, the source is found in a persistent low-flux state, characterized by a decrease in hard-X-ray luminosity and significant line-of-sight obscuration. In this state, XRISM/Resolve reveals clear Fe\,\textsc{xxv} and Fe\,\textsc{xxvi} absorption lines together with, for the first time in this source, corresponding emission lines. These features may arise either from reemission from a photoionized wind (P Cygni profile) or from collisionally ionized gas associated with outflow-driven shocks in the interstellar medium. We estimate the wind launch radius to be approximately $10^{16}~\mathrm{cm}$ ($\sim 10^4 R_{\mathrm{g}}$), consistent with the location of the X-ray broad-line region. We also resolve a broadened Fe K$\alpha$ line by $\sigma \sim 1300$ km s$^{-1}$ placing it at similar scales to the wind, consistent with radii inferred from disk-broadening models and the variability of the Fe K$\alpha$ broad line. The similarity of the Fe K$\alpha$ profile to the H$\beta$ wing and broad Pa$\alpha$ width indicates that the X-ray-emitting region is likely cospatial with the optical/IR broad-line region and originates from the same gas.
