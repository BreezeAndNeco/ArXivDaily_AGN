 - **Abstract**
 Modeling strong gravitational lenses is prohibitively expensive for modern and next-generation cosmic survey data. Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based inference (SBI) approach, has been studied as an avenue for efficient analysis of strong lensing data. However, NPE has not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data -- e.g., when trained on simulated data and then applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of NPE in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). The source domain is noiseless, and the target domain has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that combining UDA and NPE improves the accuracy of the inference by 1-2 orders of magnitude and significantly improves the posterior coverage over an NPE model without UDA. We anticipate that this combination of approaches will help enable future applications of NPE models to real observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the Atacama Large sub/Millimetre Array (ALMA) to efficiently observe spectral lines across Bands 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 at high-resolution (0.5" - 0.1") for 16 bright southern Herschel sources at $1.5 < z < 4.2$. With only six and a half hours of observations, we reveal 66 spectral lines in 17 galaxies. These observations detect emission from CO (3-2) to CO(18-17), as well as atomic ([CI](1-0), (2-1), [OI] 145 $\mu$m and [NII] 205 $\mu$m) lines. Additional molecular lines are seen in emission (${\rm H_2O}$ and ${\rm H_2O^+}$) and absorption (OH$^+$ and CH$^+$). The morphologies based on dust continuum ranges from extended sources to strong lensed galaxies with magnifications between 2 and 30. CO line transitions indicate a diverse set of excitation conditions with a fraction of the sources ($\sim 35$%) showcasing dense, warm gas. The resolved gas to star-formation surface densities vary strongly per source, and suggest that the observed diversity of dusty star-forming galaxies could be a combination of lensed, compact dusty starbursts and extended, potentially-merging galaxies. The predicted gas depletion timescales are consistent with 100 Myr to 1 Gyr, but require efficient fueling from the extended gas reservoirs onto the more central starbursts, in line with the Doppler-shifted absorption lines that indicate inflowing gas for two out of six sources. This pilot paper explores a successful new method of observing spectral lines in large samples of galaxies, supports future studies of larger samples, and finds that the efficiency of this new observational method will be further improved with the planned ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade.

 - **Abstract**
 The circumgalactic medium (CGM) in $\gtrsim 10^{12}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ halos is dominated by a hot phase ($T \gtrsim 10^{6}$ K). While many models exist for the hot gas structure, there is as yet no consensus. We compare cooling flow models, in which the hot CGM flows inward due to radiative cooling, to the CGM of $\sim 10^{12}-10^{13}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ halos in galaxy formation simulations from the FIRE project at $z\sim0$. The simulations include realistic cosmological evolution and feedback from stars but neglect AGN feedback. At both mass scales, CGM inflows are typically dominated by the hot phase rather than by the `precipitation' of cold gas. Despite being highly idealized, we find that cooling flows describe $\sim 10^{13}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ halos very well, with median agreement in the density and temperature profiles of $\sim 20\%$ and $\sim 10\%$, respectively. This indicates that stellar feedback has little impact on CGM scales in those halos. For $\sim 10^{12}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ halos, the thermodynamic profiles are also accurately reproduced in the outer CGM. For some of these lower-mass halos, cooling flows significantly overpredict the hot gas density in the inner CGM. This could be due to multidimensional angular momentum effects not well captured by our 1D cooling flow models and/or to the larger cold gas fractions in these regions. Turbulence, which contributes $\sim 10-40\%$ of the total pressure, must be included to accurately reproduce the temperature profiles. Overall, cooling flows predict entropy profiles in better agreement with the FIRE simulations than other idealized models in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 The baryonic physics shaping galaxy formation and evolution are complex, spanning a vast range of scales and making them challenging to model. Cosmological simulations rely on subgrid models that produce significantly different predictions. Understanding how models of stellar and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback affect baryon behavior across different halo masses and redshifts is essential. Using the SIMBA and IllustrisTNG suites from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project, we explore the effect of parameters governing the subgrid implementation of stellar and AGN feedback. We find that while IllustrisTNG shows higher cumulative feedback energy across all halos, SIMBA demonstrates a greater spread of baryons, quantified by the closure radius and circumgalactic medium (CGM) gas fraction. This suggests that feedback in SIMBA couples more effectively to baryons and drives them more efficiently within the host halo. There is evidence that different feedback modes are highly interrelated in these subgrid models. Parameters controlling stellar feedback efficiency significantly impact AGN feedback, as seen in the suppression of black hole mass growth and delayed activation of AGN feedback to higher mass halos with increasing stellar feedback efficiency in both simulations. Additionally, AGN feedback efficiency parameters affect the CGM gas fraction at low halo masses in SIMBA, hinting at complex, non-linear interactions between AGN and SNe feedback modes. Overall, we demonstrate that stellar and AGN feedback are intimately interwoven, especially at low redshift, due to subgrid implementation, resulting in halo property effects that might initially seem counterintuitive.

 - **Abstract**
 The AEOS project introduces a series of high-resolution cosmological simulations that model star-by-star chemical enrichment and galaxy formation in the early Universe, achieving 1 pc resolution. These simulations capture the complexities of galaxy evolution within the first ~300 Myr by modeling individual stars and their feedback processes. By incorporating chemical yields from individual stars, AEOS generates galaxies with diverse stellar chemical abundances, linking them to hierarchical galaxy formation and early nucleosynthetic events. These simulations underscore the importance of chemical abundance patterns in ancient stars as vital probes of early nucleosynthesis, star formation histories, and galaxy formation. We examine the metallicity floors of various elements resulting from Pop III enrichment, providing best-fit values for eight different metals (e.g., [O/H] = -4.0) to guide simulations without Pop III models. Additionally, we identify galaxies that begin star formation with Pop II after external enrichment and investigate the frequency of CEMP stars at varying metallicities. The AEOS simulations offer detailed insights into the relationship between star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment. Future work will extend these simulations to later epochs to interpret the diverse stellar populations of the Milky Way and its satellites.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia characterizes the stellar populations of nearby open clusters with unprecedented precision. We investigate the Böhm-Vitense gap, which has been found as a prominent feature in the stellar sequence of open clusters. Using PARSEC isochrone fitting, we derive astrophysical parameters for more than 1100 stars in Praesepe, identify more than 1100 bona fide single stars in the alpha Persei (Melotte 20) open cluster, and confirm their approximate match in terms of age (approx. 710 Myr and 45 Myr) and metallicity ([M/H] approx. +0.15 dex and +0.13 dex) to the Hyades and Pleiades, respectively. By merging data of the cluster pairs, we improve number statistics. We do not find a clear gap in the combined observational G_abs vs. BP-RP color-magnitude diagram (CMD) in the stellar mass range corresponding to the location of the Böhm-Vitense gap. We reproduce gaps in simulated Hyades-type CMDs randomly drawn from an initial mass function. There is no strong evidence for a discontinuity originating in the transition from radiative to convective energy transport in the stellar photosphere. We conclude that the observed gaps in the stellar sequences of open clusters could be explained by small number statistics and the uneven mass-color relation at the transition from spectral type A to F.

 - **Abstract**
 Classifying ionised nebulae in nearby galaxies is crucial to studying stellar feedback mechanisms and understanding the physical conditions of the interstellar medium. This classification task is generally performed by comparing observed line ratios with photoionisation simulations of different types of nebulae (HII regions, planetary nebulae, and supernova remnants). However, due to simplifying assumptions, such simulations are generally unable to fully reproduce the line ratios in observed nebulae. This discrepancy limits the performance of the classical machine-learning approach, where a model is trained on the simulated data and then used to classify real nebulae. In this study, we use a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) to bridge the gap between photoionisation models (source domain) and observed ionised nebulae from the PHANGS-MUSE survey (target domain). The DANN is an example of a domain-adaptation algorithm, whose goal is to maximise the performance of a model trained on labelled data in the source domain on an unlabelled target domain by extracting domain-invariant features. Our results indicate a significant improvement in classification performance in the target domain when employing the DANN framework compared to a classical neural network (NN) classifier. Additionally, we investigate the impact of adding noise to the source dataset, finding that noise injection acts as a form of regularisation, further enhancing the performances of both the NN and DANN models on the observational data. The combined use of domain adaptation and noise injection improves the classification accuracy in the target domain by 24%. This study highlights the potential of domain adaptation methods in tackling the domain-shift challenge when using theoretical models to train machine-learning pipelines in astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) offer a new observational window into the universe, providing insights into compact objects and cosmic structures. Gravitational lensing, commonly studied in electromagnetic waves, also affects GWs, introducing magnification, time delays, and multiple images. While existing studies focus on static lenses, many astrophysical lenses are dynamic, with time-varying mass distributions such as moving stars or orbiting binaries. We develop a general theoretical framework to describe non-static lenses and demonstrate how they modulate GW signals, inducing unique time-varying amplitude modulations and spectral broadening. By examining uniformly moving and orbiting binary lenses, we show that these modulations provide new observational signatures, enhancing our understanding of lensing objects and the dynamics of the universe. Our findings have important implications for GW astronomy, offering novel ways to probe lens dynamics and improve the interpretations of GW signals.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive contact binaries are fundamental test-beds to study properties of close binaries en route to stellar mergers. Progress in their understanding has been largely impeded due to a dearth in their observed counterparts. We accumulate 61 over-contact binary candidates from the OGLE survey of the Magellanic Clouds and form the largest known sample of such systems. We mine the OGLE-IV catalogue for B-type and earlier systems which match our synthetic light curves, and thereafter examine their properties in comparison with our binary populations. Simultaneously, we also investigate the degeneracy in the light curves between over-contact and near-contact binaries and attempt to distinguish these populations. We construct new synthetic populations of such systems from detailed $\texttt{MESA}$ models with initial parameters of M$_\textrm{total,i}=14-80\,\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ and P$_\textrm{i}=0.6-23\,$days, and compute analogous $\texttt{PHOEBE}$ light curves. We then extract OGLE systems that match our synthetic light curves and compare their numbers, and distributions in periods, absolute V-band magnitudes and colours (V-I) with our population predictions. We expect massive over-contact binaries to have smooth equal-depth light curves due to their equal-mass ($q\approx1$) and consequently, equal-temperature components. We mine 47 and 14 predominantly B-type over-contact OGLE binaries from the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds respectively, with periods of $\approx0.6-1\,$d, along with a few wider O-type systems. This sample is consistent with our theoretically expected numbers and colour-magnitude and period distributions. Additionally, we find that binaries nearing contact have periods as large as $4.5\,$d and mass ratios of $q\approx0.4-0.95$, some of which may masquerade as over-contact binaries and thereby lead to potential observational misclassifications.

 - **Abstract**
 UGC 2885 (z = 0.01935) is one of the largest and most massive galaxies in the local Universe, yet its undisturbed spiral structure is unexpected for such an object and unpredicted in cosmological simulations. Understanding the detailed properties of extreme systems such as UGC 2885 can provide insight on the limits of scaling relations and physical processes driving galaxy evolution. Our goal is to understand whether UGC 2885 has followed a similar evolutionary path to other high-mass galaxies by examining its place on the fundamental metallicity relation and the star-forming main sequence. We present new observations of UGC 2885 with the CFHT and IRAM 30-m telescopes. These novel data are used to respectively calculate metallicity and molecular hydrogen mass values. We estimate stellar mass (M*) and star formation rate (SFR) based on mid-infrared observations with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We find global metallicities Z = 9.28, 9.08 and 8.74 at the 25 kpc ellipsoid from N2O2, R23 and O3N2 indices, respectively. This puts UGC 2885 at the high end of the galaxy metallicity distribution. The molecular hydrogen mass is calculated as M(H2)=(1.89+/-0.24)e11 Msun, the SFR as 1.63+/-0.72 Msun/yr and the stellar mass as (4.83 +/- 1.52)e11 Msun, which gives a star formation efficiency (SFE = SFR/M(H2)) of (8.67+/-4.20)e12/yr. This indicates that UGC 2885 has an extremely high molecular gas content when compared to known samples of star forming galaxies (~100 times more) and a relatively low SFR for its current gas content. We conclude that UGC 2885 has gone through cycles of star formation periods, which increased its stellar mass and metallicity to its current state. The mechanisms that are fueling the current molecular gas reservoir and keeping the galaxy from producing stars remain uncertain. We discuss the possibility that a molecular bar is quenching star forming activity.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are a promising source of the binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed in gravitational waves with LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK). Constraining the AGN channel allows us to limit AGN parameter space (disk density, size, average lifetime) and nuclear star cluster (NSC) parameter space. Constraints on AGN and NSCs have implications for $\Lambda$CDM models of AGN feedback and models of AGN-driven SMBH merger and growth. Here we present several qualitative studies of the AGN channel using new public, open-source, fast, reproducible code \texttt{McFACTS}\footnote{this https URL}:Monte Carlo for AGN channel Testing \& Simulation. We demonstrate several important features for testing the AGN channel, including: i) growth to large mass IMBH is helped by the presence of migration traps or disk boundaries, ii) flat BH initial mass functions highlight hierarchical merger features in the mass spectrum, iii) high rates of dynamical encounters strongly inhibit BBH formation and merger at migration traps, iv) the ($q,\chi_{\rm eff}$) anti-correlation is a strong test of the bias to prograde mergers in the AGN channel, v) spheroid encounters can drive a fraction of mergers with high in-plane spin components ($\chi_{\rm p}$), vi) a high rate of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are driven by an initial population of embedded retrograde BH, vii) Both LVK and LISA are powerful probes of models of AGN disks and their embedded populations.
#### Magnetic reconnection-driven energization of protons up to 400 keV at the near-Sun heliospheric current sheet

 - **Abstract**
 We report observations of direct evidence of energetic protons being accelerated above ~400 keV within the reconnection exhaust of a heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossing by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at a distance of ~16.25 solar radii (Rs) from the Sun. Inside the extended exhaust, both the reconnection-generated plasma jets and the accelerated protons propagated toward the Sun, unambiguously establishing their origin from HCS reconnection sites located beyond PSP. Within the core of the exhaust, PSP detected stably trapped energetic protons up to ~400 keV, which is approximately 1000 times greater than the available magnetic energy per particle. The differential energy spectrum of the accelerated protons behaved as a pure power-law with spectral index of about -5. Supporting simulations using the kglobal model suggest that the trapping and acceleration of protons up to ~400 keV in the reconnection exhaust is likely facilitated by merging magnetic islands with a guide field between ~0.2-0.3 of the reconnecting magnetic field, consistent with the observations. These new results, enabled by PSP's proximity to the Sun, demonstrate that magnetic reconnection in the HCS is a significant new source of energetic particles in the near-Sun solar wind. The discovery of in-situ particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection at the HCS provides valuable insights into this fundamental process which frequently converts the large magnetic field energy density in the near-Sun plasma environment and may be responsible for heating the sun's atmosphere, accelerating the solar wind, and energizing charged particles to extremely high energies in solar flares.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic field in the Sun's corona stores energy that can be released to heat the coronal plasma and drive solar eruptions. Measurements of the global coronal magnetic field have been limited to a few snapshots. We present observations using the Upgraded Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter, which provided 114 magnetograms of the global corona above the solar limb spanning approximately eight months. We determined the magnetic field distributions at different solar radii in the corona, and monitored the evolution at different latitudes over multiple solar rotations. We found varying field strengths from <1 to 20 Gauss within 1.05-1.6 solar radii and a signature of active longitude in the coronal magnetic field. Coronal models are generally consistent with the observational data, with larger discrepancies in high-latitude regions.

 We present the results of a search for gravitational-wave transients associated with core-collapse supernova SN 2023ixf, which was observed in the galaxy Messier 101 via optical emission on 2023 May 19th, during the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA 15th Engineering Run. We define a five-day on-source window during which an accompanying gravitational-wave signal may have occurred. No gravitational waves have been identified in data when at least two gravitational-wave observatories were operating, which covered $\sim 14\%$ of this five-day window. We report the search detection efficiency for various possible gravitational-wave emission models. Considering the distance to M101 (6.7 Mpc), we derive constraints on the gravitational-wave emission mechanism of core-collapse supernovae across a broad frequency spectrum, ranging from 50 Hz to 2 kHz where we assume the GW emission occurred when coincident data are available in the on-source window. Considering an ellipsoid model for a rotating proto-neutron star, our search is sensitive to gravitational-wave energy $1 \times 10^{-5} M_{\odot} c^2$ and luminosity $4 \times 10^{-5} M_{\odot} c^2/\text{s}$ for a source emitting at 50 Hz. These constraints are around an order of magnitude more stringent than those obtained so far with gravitational-wave data. The constraint on the ellipticity of the proto-neutron star that is formed is as low as $1.04$, at frequencies above $1200$ Hz, surpassing results from SN 2019ejj.

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial-temporal evolution of coronal plasma parameters of the solar outer atmosphere at global scales, derived from solar full-disk imaging spectroscopic observation in the extreme-ultraviolet band, is critical for understanding and forecasting solar eruptions. We propose a multi-slits extreme ultraviolet imaging spectrograph for global coronal diagnostics with high cadence and present the preliminary instrument designs for the wavelength range from 18.3 to 19.8 nm. The instrument takes a comprehensive approach to obtain global coronal spatial and spectral information, improve the detected cadence and avoid overlapping. We first describe the relationship between optical properties and structural parameters, especially the relationship between the overlapping and the number of slits, and give a general multi-slits extreme-ultraviolet imaging spectrograph design process. Themultilayer structure is optimized to enhance the effective areas in the observation band. Five distantly-separated slits are set to divide the entire solar field of view, which increase the cadence for raster scanning the solar disk by 5 times relative to a single slit. The spectral resolving power of the optical system with an aperture diameter of 150 mm are optimized to be greater than 1461. The spatial resolution along the slits direction and the scanning direction are about 4.4''and 6.86'', respectively. The Al/Mo/B4C multilayer structure is optimized and the peak effective area is about 1.60 cm2 at 19.3 nm with a full width at half maximum of about 1.3 nm. The cadence to finish full-disk raster scan is about 5 minutes. Finally, the instrument performance is evaluated by an end-to-end calculation of the system photon budget and a simulation of the observational image and spectra. Our investigation shows that this approach is promising for global coronal plasma diagnostics.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the HST WFC3 G141 grism slitless spectroscopy observation of the core region of the Spiderweb protocluster at $z=2.16$. We analyzed the spectra of all objects in a $\sim 2 \times 2 \text{ arcmin}^2$ field of view and identified 40 protocluster members, recovering 19 previously identified H$\alpha$-emitters in addition to revealing 21 new members. The spectra allowed us to identify 11 galaxies with quiescent spectra. Three galaxies with quiescent spectra are possibly still star-forming according to SED fitting, indicating a possible left-over or dust-obscured star formation. We estimate a quiescent fraction of $\sim 50\%$ for $M_\star > 10^{11} M_\odot$. About half of the quiescent galaxies possibly host AGN, hinting at AGN's key role in quenching galaxies in the protocluster environment. These quiescent galaxies have relatively more compact and concentrated light profiles than the star-forming members, but they are not yet as bulge-dominated as local ellipticals. These results are consistent with previous studies that indicate the Spiderweb protocluster is in the maturing stage, with a red sequence that has begun forming.

 - **Abstract**
 The Ly$\alpha$ forest, a series of HI absorption lines in the quasar spectra, is a powerful tool for probing the large-scale structure of the intergalactic medium. Its three-dimensional (3D) correlation and cross-correlations with quasars allow precise measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation feature and redshift space distortions at redshifts $z>2$. Understanding small-scale astrophysical phenomena, such as star formation and feedback, is crucial for full-shape analyses. In this study, we measure the 3D auto-power spectrum of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and its cross-power spectrum with halos using hydrodynamic simulations from the GADGET3-OSAKA code, which includes models for star formation and supernova feedback. Across five astrophysical models, we find significant deviations from the Fiducial model, with $5-10\,\%$ differences for wavenumbers $k>2\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ in the Ly$\alpha$ auto-power spectrum. The Ly$\alpha\,\times\,$halo cross-power spectra show even larger deviations, exceeding $10\,\%$ in some cases. Using the fitting models of Arinyo-i-Prats et al. (2015) and Givans et al. (2022), we jointly fit the Ly$\alpha$ auto- and Ly$\alpha$ $\times$ halo cross-power spectra, and assess the accuracy of the estimated $f\sigma_8$ parameter by comparing it with the ground truth from the simulations, while varying the maximum wavenumber $k_\mathrm{max}$ and minimum halo mass $M_h$. Our results demonstrate that the extended model of Givans et al. (2022) is highly effective in reproducing $f\sigma_8$ at $k_\mathrm{max}\leq3.0\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $M_h>10^{10.5} M_\odot$, and remains robust against astrophysical uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the launch of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in 2010 and throughout the solar cycle 24, the Sun has produced few tens of xclass flares, which are the most energetic solar events. Those flares are produced in regions where the magnetic flux/energy is large and the magnetic configurations are complex. To provide more insights into the flaring process, we investigate the properties of magnetic null points (MNPs) and their correlation with the energy release sites. During solar cycle 24, we identify 17 xclass flares satisfying selection criteria. From SDO/HMI magnetograms, we perform potential extrapolations around the peak time of the flare to access the 3D coronal magnetic field and thus investigate the existence of coronal MNPs. We then correlate the flaring sites with the existing MNPs using SDO/AIA 171A EUV observations, and deduce their properties (sign, spine, fan). Six active regions out of 10 possess at least one MNP, which is stable and with large magnetic field gradients: this implies that 35% of xclass flares are associated with a MNP; of which 87.5% of MNPs are of positive type. The MNPs associated with the flare sites are predominantly located ata height between 05 and 2 Mm, and with a vertical/radial spine field line. We also find a slight correlation between the MNPs not associated with a flare and negative-type MNPs (55%) within the active region. Regarding the physics of flares, the association between the enhanced intensity at the flaring site and a MNP represents about a third of the possible scenarios for triggering xclass flares.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of an extreme flux decrease accompanied by clear dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM) variations for pulsar B1929+10 during the 110-minute radio observation with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The radio flux decreases by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude within a rapid time scale of about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, the variations of DM and RM are approximately 0.05 pc cm$^{-3}$ and 0.7 rad m$^{-2}$, respectively. Frequency-dependent analysis of DM indicates an extremely weak chromatic DM feature, which does not notably affect the radiative behavior detected. Moreover, the pulsar timing analysis shows an additional time delay from 100 $\mu$s to 400 $\mu$s in the event. These results are speculated to be due to the eclipse and bend for the radio emission of pulsar B1929+10 by a highly dense outflow from the pulsar. This not only impacts the intrinsic radio emission feature but also affects the pulsar timing behavior. Nevertheless, a plasma lens effect lasting around 20 minutes could also be responsible for the event.

 - **Abstract**
 We simulate the dynamics of about 600 quantum vortices in a spinning-down cylindrical container using a Gross--Pitaevskii model. For the first time, we find convincing spatial-temporal evidence of avalanching behaviour resulting from vortex depinning and collective motion. During a typical avalanche, about 10 to 20 vortices exit the container in a short period, producing a glitch in the superfluid angular momentum and a localised void in the vorticity. After the glitch, vortices continue to depin and circulate around the vorticity void in a similar manner to that seen in previous point-vortex simulations. We present evidence of collective vortex motion throughout this avalanche process. We also show that the effective Magnus force can be used to predict when and where avalanches will occur. Lastly, we comment on the challenge of extrapolating these results to conditions in real neutron stars, which contain many orders of magnitude more vortices.

 - **Abstract**
 Matter falling onto black holes, {also called} accretion discs, emit intense high-energy radiation. Accretion discs during {hard to hard intermediate} spectral states also emit bipolar outflows. Radiation drag was supposed to impose the upper limit on the terminal speed. It was later shown that a radiation field around an advective accretion disc imposes no upper limit on speed, about a few hundred of Schwarzschild radius from the disc surface. We {study radiatively driven electron-proton and electron-positron jets, for gemeotrically thick and slim transonic discs} by using numerical simulation. We show that pair-dominated jets can reach ultra-relativistic speeds by radiation driving. We also discuss at what limits radiative acceleration may fail.

 - **Abstract**
 In this catalog, we present the results of a systematic study of 199 short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by Konus-Wind between 2011 January 1 and 2021 August 31. The catalog extends the Second Catalog of short gamma-ray bursts covering the period 1994-2010 by ten years of data. The resulting Konus-Wind short GRB sample includes 494 bursts. From temporal and spectral analyses of the sample, we provide the burst durations, spectral lags, estimates of the minimum variability time scales, rise and decay times, the results of spectral fits with three model functions, the total energy fluences, and the peak energy fluxes of the bursts. We present statistical distributions of these parameters for the complete set of 494 short gamma-ray bursts detected in 1994-2021. We discuss evidence found for an additional spectral component and the presence of extended emission in a fraction of the short GRBs. Finally, we consider the results in the context of the Type I (merger-origin)/Type II (collapsar-origin) classification, and discuss magnetar giant flare sub-sample.
#### Joining the Dots: High Redshift Black holes

 - **Abstract**
 A recent paper (King, 2024) suggested that emission from the central supermassive black holes in high-redshift galaxies must be tightly collimated by the effects of partly expelling a super-Eddington mass supply. I show here that this idea predicts that these galaxies should produce very little detectable rest-frame X-ray emission, appear Compton thick, and show no easily detectable sign of outflows. All of these properties agree with current observations. To produce these effects, the mass supply to the black holes should exceed the Eddington rate by factors 50 - 100, which appears in line with conditions during the early growth of the holes. I note that theoretical derivations of the ratio of black hole mass to host galaxy stellar mass already predict that this should increase significantly at high redshift, in line with recent observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Terzan 5 and Liller 1 are the only bulge stellar clusters hosting multi-iron and multi-age stellar populations. They are therefore claimed to constitute a novel class of astrophysical objects: the fossils of massive star-forming clumps that possibly sank to the center of the Milky Way and contributed to the formation of the bulge. This is based on the hypothesis that the ancient clumps were able to retain iron-enriched supernova ejecta, later giving rise to younger and more metal-rich populations. Aims. A way to investigate this scenario is reconstructing their star formation histories (SFHs) and proving a prolonged and multi-episode star formation activity. Methods. Leveraging ground- and space-based high-resolution images, we derived the SFH of Terzan 5 by employing the color-magnitude diagram fitting routine SFERA. Results. The best-fit solution predicts an old, main peak occurred between 12 and 13 Gyr ago that generated 70 % of the current stellar mass, followed by a lower-rate star formation activity with two main additional bursts. Conclusions. These results indicate that Terzan 5, similarly to Liller 1, experienced a prolonged, multiepisode star formation activity, fueled by metal-enriched gas deposited in its central regions, in agreement with the expectations of a self-enrichment scenario in a primordial massive clump.

 - **Abstract**
 Rocky exoplanets are faint and difficult to observe due to their small size and low brightness compared to their host star. Despite this, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has allowed us new methods and opportunities to study them. Accurately characterising exoplanet atmospheres could offer insights not only into the planetary demographics of rocky worlds in the universe, but also how our own Earth compares. Previous work simulating the observational spectra of planets with various models of atmospheric composition has constrained conditions under which specific molecules would be observable. We seek a different approach that does not depend on specific molecular features, but rather on correlating "agnostic" spectral characteristics to each other. This study uses 42 synthetic transit transmission spectra in a range matching that of JWST's MIRI instrument. Spectra were de-noised, normalised and split into bands for which the enclosed areas were calculated. Using the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, separation patterns and clusters were found across these bands, which correlated to various a priori planet characteristics, such as relative gas concentration. Using 0.7 $\mu$m bands between 7 and 12 $\mu$m, we are able to separate reducing vs. oxic atmospheres and constrain CO$_2$ and O$_2$ mixing ratios accurate to within two orders of magnitude in an unknown sample. Through this, we have demonstrated that it is possible to differentiate and analyse exoplanet atmosphere type from agnostic interrogation of their transit spectra with a method we call "Molecule Agnostic Spectral Clustering".
#### Dust ring and gap formation by gas flow induced by low-mass planets embedded in protoplanetary disks $\rm II$. Time-dependent model

 - **Abstract**
 The observed dust rings and gaps in protoplanetary disks could be imprints of forming planets. Even low-mass planets in the one-to-ten Earth-mass regime, that do not yet carve deep gas gaps, can generate such dust rings and gaps by driving a radially-outwards gas flow, as shown in previous work. However, understanding the creation and evolution of these dust structures is challenging due to dust drift and diffusion, requiring an approach beyond previous steady state models. Here we investigate the time evolution of the dust surface density influenced by the planet-induced gas flow, based on post-processing three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We find that planets larger than a dimensionless thermal mass of $m=0.05$, corresponding to 0.3 Earth mass at 1 au or 1.7 Earth masses at 10 au, generate dust rings and gaps, provided that solids have small Stokes numbers} (${\rm St}\lesssim10^{-2}$) and that the disk midplane is weakly turbulent ($\alpha_{\rm diff}\lesssim10^{-4}$). As dust particles pile up outside the orbit of the planet, the interior gap expands with time, when the advective flux dominates over diffusion. Dust gap depths range from a factor a few, to several orders of magnitude, depending on planet mass and the level of midplane particle diffusion. We construct a semi-analytic model describing the width of the dust ring and gap, and then compare it with the observational data. We find that up to 65\% of the observed wide-orbit gaps could be explained as resulting from the presence of a low-mass planet, assuming $\alpha_{\rm diff}=10^{-5}$ and ${\rm St}=10^{-3}$. However, it is more challenging to explain the observed wide rings, which in our model would require the presence of a population of small particles (${\rm St=10^{-4}}$). Further work is needed to explore the role of pebble fragmentation, planet migration, and the effect of multiple planets.

 - **Abstract**
 The effect of baryon physics associated with galaxy formation onto the large-scale matter distribution of the Universe is a key uncertainty in the theoretical modelling required for the interpretation of Stage IV cosmology surveys. We use the FLAMINGO suite of simulations to study the baryon response due to galaxy formation of the total matter power spectrum. We find that it is only well converged for simulation volumes in excess of $(200~Mpc)^3$. We report results for simulations of varying feedback intensity, which either match the X-ray inferred gas fractions in clusters and the z=0 stellar mass function, or shifted versions of the data, as well as for different implementations of AGN feedback. We package our results in the form of a Gaussian process emulator which can rapidly reproduce all the simulations' predictions to better than 1% up to the comoving wavenumber $k = 10~h/Mpc$ and up to z=2 for all the feedback models present in the FLAMINGO suite. We find that the response becomes stronger, the range of scales affected increases, and the position of the minimum of the response moves to smaller scales as the redshift decreases. We find that lower gas fractions in groups and clusters lead to a stronger response and that the use of collimated jets instead of thermally driven winds for AGN feedback enhances the effect. Lowering the stellar masses at fixed cluster gas fractions also increases the magnitude of the response. We find only a small (1% at $k<10~h/Mpc$) dependence of our results on the background cosmology, but a wider range of cosmology variations will be needed to confirm this result. The response we obtain for our strongest feedback models is compatible with some of the recent analyses combining weak lensing with external data. Such a response is, however, in strong tension with the X-ray inferred gas fractions in clusters used to calibrate the FLAMINGO model.
