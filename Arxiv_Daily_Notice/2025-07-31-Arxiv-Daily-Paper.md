#### Probing Turbulence, Gravity, Supernovae, and Magnetic Field Effects with the 6D Kinematics of Young Stars in Milky Way Star-Forming Regions

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics of star forming gas can be affected by many physical processes, such as turbulence, gravity, supernova explosions, and magnetic fields. In this paper, we investigate several nearby star forming regions (Orion, Upper Sco, Taurus, and Perseus) for kinematic imprints of these influences on the newly formed stars. Using Gaia DR3 astrometry and APOGEE DR17 radial velocities, we compute first-order velocity structure functions (VSFs) of young stars in galactic Cartesian coordinates in both 6D (3D positions and 3D velocities) and 4D (3D positions and each 1D velocity) to identify signatures of turbulence and anisotropic motion. We also construct 3D and 1D radial velocity profiles to identify coherent expansion trends, and compare stellar proper motions to plane-of-sky magnetic field orientations in Taurus and Perseus. We find that the VSFs are mildly anisotropic, with slightly different amplitudes, slopes, or features in different directions in several groups, but in general, they are all consistent with Larson's Relation at intermediate length scales, especially in less compact groups. In several cases, the VSFs exhibit features suggestive of local energy injection from supernovae. Radial velocity profiles reveal clear anisotropic expansion in multiple groups, with the most extreme cases corresponding to those with the most anisotropic VSFs. In Perseus, we find that the motions of young stars are preferentially perpendicular to the local magnetic field. We find multiple, overlapping causes in each group for the observed kinematics. Our findings support that young stars remember more than just the turbulent state of their natal clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the diversity of dark matter (DM) density profiles in a large sample of late-type galaxies from the SPARC database, with the goal of testing whether a cusp-to-core transition occurs across galaxy mass scales. We perform Bayesian fits to high-quality rotation curves using flexible halo models that allow for variations in the inner slopes of DM density profiles. We quantify the central dark matter structure using the surface density within the inner region of the halo, defined as $\Sigma_{\rm DM}(<0.01r_{V_{\rm max}})$, and compare the SPARC galaxies with Milky Way dwarf satellites as well as galaxy groups and clusters. Our results reveal significant diversity in the inner density slopes of SPARC galaxies, ranging from steep cusps to shallow cores, and show that many of them lie below the cuspy profiles predicted by the cold dark matter model, consistent with core-like structures. In contrast, both lower-mass dwarf galaxies and higher-mass galaxy clusters tend to follow the cuspy DM halos. These findings suggest that baryonic feedback may induce a cusp-to-core transition in Milky Way-mass galaxies, as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations. However, observational limitations and modeling uncertainties still prevent a definitive conclusion. This study provides new empirical insights into the halo mass-dependent nature of DM inner structures and the role of baryonic processes in shaping them.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the recently discovered \emph{pair-Alfvén shock wave} occurring in collisionless electron-positron plasmas. We perform a series of Particle-In-Cell studies in one and two dimensions in order to determine the stability conditions for such a shock and the mechanisms which sustain its growth. Building on our previous simulations, which established that these shocks are initially mediated by the Weibel instability before becoming Alfvénic, we demonstrate that the shock is sustained by self-generated Alfvén waves overtaking the shock in the upstream plasma. As a result growth is only possible when the guiding magnetic field strength, and hence Alfvén speed, is sufficiently small, $\omega_c \lesssim 0.4$ (in normalized units). Furthermore the production of the waves in the upstream is dependent on a resonance between the Alfvén wave mode and the thermal noise in the plasma, which is inhibited at high magnetization. This explains the conditional absence of this type of shock identified previously.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) with extremely red optical-to-infrared colors are often associated with intense starburst and AGN activity. Studying DOGs can provide insights into the processes that drive the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. However, the general DOG population is heterogeneous, spanning a wide range of evolutionary stages, and has X-ray obscuring column densities ($N_\mathrm{H}$) covering low-to-high levels. In this work, we focus on seven high Eddington ratio DOGs ($\log \lambda_\mathrm{Edd} \gtrsim -0.5$) to examine their X-ray obscuration properties using new and archival X-ray observations. We confirm that these systems are generally heavily obscured, with 6/7 having $N_\mathrm{H}\gtrsim10^{23}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ and 3/7 having $N_\mathrm{H}\gtrsim10^{24}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. Based on the observed similarity with the rare Hot DOG population, we argue that both high-$\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ DOGs and Hot DOGs likely trace the post-merger phase during which AGNs are enshrouded by large columns of dust-rich material.

 - **Abstract**
 As tracers of the underlying mass distributions, galaxies' peculiar velocities are valuable probes of the Universe, allowing us to measure the Hubble constant or to map the large scale structure and its dynamics. Yet, catalogs of peculiar velocities are noisy, scarce and prone to various interpretation biases. We aim to measure the bulk flow and the Hubble constant directly from the largest available sample of peculiar velocities, and without imposing a cosmological prior on the velocity field. To address these issues, we analyze the Cosmicflows-4 catalog, the most extensive catalog of galaxy peculiar velocities, reaching a redshift $z=0.1$. Specifically, we construct a forward modeling approach assuming only a flat Universe, which reconstructs the radial and bulk flows of the velocity field directly from measurements of peculiar velocities. Our method accurately recovers cosmological parameters within a radius of $120\ \mathrm{Mpc/h}$ that can then be compared with the predictions from $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$. Apart from a $3\sigma$ tension with $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ on the magnitude around $120\ \mathrm{Mpc/h}$ associated with a $4\sigma$ tension on the supergalactic $X$ direction, we find a general agreement between the standard model and the observations. Lastly, our analysis suggests a Hubble constant value of approximately $75.8\pm0.4\ \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, exacerbating (or independently confirming) the existing ``Hubble tension", however, for the first time accomplished with the largest set of peculiar velocities in existence.

 - **Abstract**
 Intrinsically faint galaxies at $z\sim2-3$ offer critical insights into early galaxy formation, tracing low-metallicity, low-mass systems during Cosmic Noon and serving as analogs to reionization-era galaxies. We present ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of nine low-luminosity galaxies ($-17 \lesssim M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -20$, $M_\star \lesssim 10^9\,M_\odot$) at $z\sim2.5$ from the CECILIA program, with $\sim$29.5 hr in G235M/F170LP and 1 hr in G395M/F290LP. Our sample includes four LAEs, three rest-UV color-selected galaxies, and two serendipitous detections -- providing the most sensitive rest-optical spectra of individual faint galaxies at this epoch to date. Balmer-line measurements reveal low SFRs ($0.63 < \mathrm{SFR}/(M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) < 5.43$) and a broad range of dust reddening ($0 < E(B-V) < 1$), with SFRs systematically below those of continuum-selected galaxies. Electron densities are low ($n_e \lesssim 200$cm$^{-3}$), and emission-line diagnostics indicate low [NII]/H$\alpha$, high [OIII]/H$\beta$, suggesting metallicities $12+\log({\rm O/H})\lesssim8.0$. We also present the first O1-BPT constraints in such faint high-redshift galaxies. Notably, two galaxies show low [OIII]/H$\beta$ despite high Ly$\alpha$ EWs and very low [NII]/H$\alpha$, consistent with the predicted turnover in this ratio at very low metallicities -- highlighting the need for complementary diagnostics (e.g., N2, O32) to identify metal-poor systems. Direct $T_e$-based abundances and expanded samples are needed to further trace metallicity and ionization trends in low-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Phase curves of small bodies are useful tools to obtain their absolute magnitudes and phase coefficients. The former relates to the object's apparent brightness, while the latter relates to how the light interacts with the surface. Data from multi-wavelength photometric surveys, which usually serendipitously observe small bodies, are becoming the cornerstone of large statistical studies of the Solar System. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, all studies have been carried out in visible wavelengths. Aims. We aim to provide the first catalog of absolute magnitudes in near-infrared filters (Y, J, H, and K). We will study the applicability of a non-linear model to these data and compare it with a simple linear model. Methods. We compute the absolute magnitudes using two photometric models: the HG* 12 and the linear model. We employ a combination of Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo sampling to calculate the probability distributions of the absolute magnitudes and their corresponding phase coefficients. We use the combination of four near-infrared photometric catalogs to create our input database. Results. We produced the first catalog of near-infrared magnitudes. We obtained absolute magnitudes for over 10 000 objects (with at least one absolute magnitude measured), with about 180 objects having four absolute magnitudes. We confirmed that a linear model that fits the phase curves produces accurate results. Since a linear behavior well describes the curves, fitting to a restricted phase angle range (in particular, larger than 9.5 deg) does not substantially affect the results. Finally, we also detect a phase-coloring effect in the near-infrared, as observed in visible wavelengths for asteroids and trans-Neptunian objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Chandra observations of 63 sources from the Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph$-$Distant Quasar Survey (GNIRS-DQS) of which 54 were targeted by snapshot observations in Cycle 24. A total of 55 sources are clearly detected in at least one X-ray band, and we set stringent upper limits on the X-ray fluxes of the remaining eight sources. In combination with rest-frame ultraviolet-optical spectroscopic data for these sources, we assess whether X-rays can provide a robust accretion-rate indicator for quasars, particularly at the highest accessible redshifts. We utilize a recently modified H$\beta$-based Eddington luminosity ratio estimator, as well as the C IV $\lambda$1549 emission-line parameter space to investigate trends and correlations with the optical-X-ray spectral slope ($\alpha_{\mathrm{ox}}$) and the effective hard-X-ray power-law photon index ($\Gamma$). We find that $\alpha_{\mathrm{ox}}$ does not improve current accretion-rate estimates based on H$\beta$ or C IV. Instead, within the limitations of our sample, we confirm previous findings that the C IV parameter space may be a better indicator of the accretion rate up to $z\sim3.5$. We also find that the average $\Gamma$ values for a small subset of our sources, as well as the average $\Gamma$ value in different groupings of our sources, are consistent with their respective relatively high Eddington luminosity ratios. Deeper X-ray observations of our X-ray-detected sources are needed for measuring $\Gamma$ accurately and testing whether this parameter can serve as a robust, un-biased accretion-rate diagnostic.

 - **Abstract**
 Evidence suggests the existence of a large planet in the outer Solar System, Planet Nine, with a predicted mass of 6.6 +2.6 / -1.7 Earth masses (Brown et al., 2024). Based on mass radius composition models, planet formation theory, and confirmed exoplanets with low mass and radius uncertainty and equilibrium temperature less than 600 K, we determine the most likely composition for Planet Nine is a mini-Neptune with a radius in the range 2.0 to 2.6 Earth radii and a H-He envelope fraction in the range of 0.6 percent to 3.5 percent by mass. Using albedo estimates for a mini-Neptune extrapolated from V-band data for the Solar Systems giant planets gives albedo values for Planet Nine in the range of 0.47 to 0.33. Using the most likely orbit and aphelion estimates from the Planet Nine Reference Population 3.0, we estimate Planet Nines absolute magnitude in the range of -6.1 to -5.2 and apparent magnitude in the range of +21.9 to +22.7. Finally, we estimate that, if the hypothetical Planet Nine exists and is detected by upcoming surveys, it will have a resolvable disk using some higher resolution world class telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Cataclysmic variable (CVs) are close interacting binaries in which a white dwarf accretes materials from a low mass main sequence companion. CVs can experience nova eruptions due to low mass transfer rates. In the standard theory of CV evolution, the ejected materials during nova eruptions are assumed to leave the system in the form of fast, isotropic, optically thick winds, which predicts that novae only result in positive variation (expansion) of orbital period (i.e. positive $\Delta P$). In addition, the angular momentum losses (magnetic braking and gravitational radiation) only predicts a steady long-term decay in the orbital period of CVs, i.e. $\dot P$ is negative. Interestingly, an observation lasting over 30 years reveals positive and negative values for both $\Delta P$ and $\dot P$ in CVs, strongly conflicting with the standard evolutionary patterns. However, it cannot be excluded that these observations originate from short-term phenomena caused by nova eruptions because of a short timescale of observations. In this paper, we model the effect of instantaneous nova eruptions on the evolution of CVs, considering three mechanisms associated with mass loss in nova eruptions, including fast wind, Frank jet and binary-driven mass loss. By assuming that the observed $\Delta P$ and $\dot P$ are dominated by short-term phenomena, our results show that the binary-driven mass loss can explain almost all of the observations of normal CVs. However, the Frank jet may be needed for some of long-period CVs with evolved companions.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of Active Galaxy Nuclei (AGN) can affect the morphological classification of galaxies. This work aims to determine how the contribution of AGN affects the most used morphological parameters down to the redshift of z~2 in COSMOS-like conditions. We use a sample of > 2000 local non-active galaxies, with a well-known visual morphological classification, and add an AGN as an unresolved component that contributes to the total galaxy flux with 5%-75%. We moved all the galaxies to lower magnitudes (higher redshifts) to map the conditions in the COSMOS field, and we measured six morphological parameters. The greatest impact on morphology occurs when considering the combined effect of magnitude, redshift and AGN, with spiral galaxies being the most affected. In general, all the concentration parameters change significantly if the AGN contribution is > 25% and the magnitude > 23. We find that the GINI coefficient is the most stable in terms of AGN and magnitude/redshift, followed by the M20, Conselice-Bershady (CCON), and finally the Abraham (CABR) concentration indexes. We find that, when using morphological parameters, the combination of CABR, CCON and asymmetry is the most effective in classifying active galaxies at high-redshift, followed by the combination of CABR and GINI.

 - **Abstract**
 When dense cores in molecular clouds or filamentary structures collapse and form protostars, they may undergo fragmentation and form binary or multiple systems. In this paper, we investigated the key mechanisms influencing fragmentation by comparing the physical conditions of fragmented and unfragmented dense cores (~0.1 pc) in Orion A. Utilizing archival submillimeter continuum data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array survey of Class 0 and I protostars at a 0.''1 resolution, we identified 38 dense cores hosting single protostars and 15 cores hosting binary or multiple systems. We measured the dense cores properties with the Herschel dust temperature, Nobeyama 45m N$_2$H$^+$ J=1-0, and JCMT polarization data. Our results reveal that the dense cores hosting binary/multiple systems exhibit significantly higher density and Mach number compared to those hosting single protostars, while there are no correlations between the occurrence of fragmentation and the energy ratios of turbulence and magnetic field to gravity. Our results suggest that the higher density and supersonic turbulence of the dense cores can lead to local collapse and fragmentation to form binary/multiple systems, while the magnetic field has limited influence on fragmentation in the dense cores in Orion A.
#### Exploring Impact Vapor Plume Reactions from Asteroidal Impacts: Monte Carlo Simulations and Implications for Biomolecules Synthesis

 - **Abstract**
 During a hypervelocity impact, both the impactor and target materials evaporate, generating an impact vapor plume with temperatures reaching several thousand K. As the plume cools through adiabatic expansion, chemical reactions are predicted to quench, leading to a non-equilibrium composition. However, it is still unclear how chemical reactions proceed during the cooling impact vapor plume and lead to the synthesis of organic molecules. In this study, to investigate the evolution of chemical composition within impact vapor plumes, we conducted a Monte Carlo chemical reaction simulation for complex organic synthesis, developed in our previous work. Our model does not rely on a predefined reaction network; instead, it utilizes imposed conditions for chemical changes and an approximate method for calculating reaction rates suited to our objectives. Additionally, we developed a new approach to couple these chemical reaction calculations with the rapid temperature and pressure decay in the vapor plume. Results show diverse organic molecule production depending on the impactor materials assumed in this study. These products include important precursors to biomolecules such as amino acids, sugars, and nucleobases. On the other hand, for all impactor compositions, the abundance of biomolecules themselves remains extremely low throughout the reactions from an impact to quenching. Therefore, our results suggest that biomolecules are not directly produced in impact vapor plumes but rather synthesized through reactions of these precursor molecules in aqueous solutions, following H2O condensation as the vapor plume cools. Many of the detected organic compounds, including the precursor molecules such as imine compounds and formamide, are not included in the reaction networks of previous kinetic model simulations, and their formation has not been predicted.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the dynamics of low angular momentum accretion flow around black holes (BHs) is essential for probing extreme plasma behavior in strong gravity, where shock formation can naturally produce variability signatures. In this paper, we perform general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of low angular momentum accretion flows onto a BH with different BH spins to investigate the accretion dynamics near the central BH region. The simulation results show the standard and normal evolution (SANE) regime in all cases. In particular, we report the formation and persistence of standing shocks in low-angular-momentum accretion flows using multi (two and three)-dimensional GRMHD simulations for the first time. Previous studies did not detect such stable standing shock structures, making our findings a significant advancement in this field. The finding of shock dynamics can be further associated with some radiation features, such as flares observed in Sgr~A$^\ast$ and quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signals detected in some XRBs and AGNs.
#### Can a convecting magma ocean offer a solution to the puzzling case of core convection in early earth?

 - **Abstract**
 Convective flow in Earth's iron-rich liquid core drives self-sustained dynamo action, generating Earth's magnetic field, which is strongest among all terrestrial planets of the solar system. Rock records show that this magnetic field has been operative in Earth for at least 3.4 billion years (b.y). However, advanced high pressure experiments have revised the value of the thermal conductivity of the outer core, which implies an age for the inner core of less than 1 b.y., when compositional convection begins. This creates a puzzle, with a gap between the observations of an early magnetic field on Earth and the young inner core. Previous work has suggested that the pre-inner core dynamo could have been generated in a magma ocean (MO) at the base of the mantle; however, the fluid dynamics of this scenario have received little attention. Here we numerically model the non-magnetic rotating flow in a MO above a convectively stable core in a configuration representing the pre-inner core days of Earth's evolution. Simulations here explore the importance of several dimensionless parameters on coupled core-MO convection -- the Rayleigh number, the ocean/core thermal diffusivity ratio, thermal expansion coefficient ratio, viscosity ratio, and layer thickness ratio. It is found that the MO can easily drive a flow of comparable magnitude in the core, and an approximately linear relationship is observed between the ratio of root-mean-square velocities in the core and the ocean, $(u_c^{RMS}/u_o^{RMS})$, and $(\Nu_o-1)$, where $\Nu_o$ is the Nusselt number for the MO, for the $\Nu_o$ of order 1 to 10 considered. Radial and azimuthal components of the core flow are of similar magnitude, so that, with comparable toroidal and poloidal components, we speculate that the MO-driven core flow could drive an early dynamo.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a scenario that could explain non-thermal particle acceleration in relativistic quasi-perpendicular electron-positron shocks, such as the termination shock of pulsar wind nebulae. The shock produces a strong electromagnetic precursor that propagates into the upstream plasma, which is initially threaded by a uniform background magnetic field. We show that the filamentation instability breaks the precursor into radiation filaments parallel to the shock normal. The transverse scale of the filaments is of the order of a few plasma skin depths. In the shock frame, the bulk Lorentz factor of the upstream plasma is significantly reduced inside the radiation filaments. Then, the instability produces a relativistic shear flow with strong velocity gradients on kinetic scales. The velocity gradients distort the background magnetic field lines, and generate a magnetic field component parallel to the shock normal that reverses across each radiation filament, a configuration that could trigger magnetic reconnection in the upstream plasma. These effects may accelerate particles before the plasma enters the shock.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the evolution of cosmic acceleration in a spatially flat $w_0w_a$CDM universe, in which the equation of state of dark energy takes the CPL parametrization, using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), in combination with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and several type Ia supernova datasets, including PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5. We analyze the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ and the jerk parameter $j(z)$ and further validate our results using the $Om(z)$ diagnostic. Our findings indicate significant deviations from the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Specifically, DESI BAO, DESI BAO + CMB, DESI BAO + CMB + Union3, and DESI BAO + CMB + DESY5 all provide strong evidence for a slowing down of cosmic acceleration at late times, as indicated by $j(0) < 0$ at more than 1$\sigma$ confidence level, within the framework of $w_0w_a$CDM model. These results suggest that in the $w_0w_a$CDM universe cosmic acceleration has already peaked and is now in a phase of decline.
#### A MaNGA about the Legacy I: Connecting the Assembly of Stellar Halo with the Average Star Formation History in Low-Redshift Massive Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the connection between stellar mass distribution, assembly history, and star formation timescales in low-redshift massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) by combining deep LegacySurvey imaging with MaNGA's spatially resolved spectroscopy. Focusing on stellar population properties, especially the [Mg/Fe] abundance ratio, we analyze stacked spectra using both absorption line indices and full-spectrum fitting. We find that, among massive ETGs with identical average stellar mass distributions beyond 5 kpc, those with higher central velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{cen}$) are older and more $\alpha$-enhanced, suggesting a connection between the in-situ star formation in the past and the central gravitational potential today for massive ETGs with a similar stellar accretion history. Conversely, at fixed $\sigma_{cen}$ and total stellar mass, galaxies with more extended stellar halos show lower [Fe/H], higher [Mg/Fe], and older ages, indicating an intriguing link between early starburst and quenching and later ex-situ assembly. These results demonstrate that the evolution of massive galaxies cannot be fully described by simple scaling relations alone, as the interplay between in-situ star formation and ex-situ accretion leaves distinct imprints in both their inner and outer stellar populations. Our findings highlight the importance of extending stellar population studies to large radii and underscore the scientific potential of next-generation IFU surveys and deep, high-resolution spectroscopy for probing the galaxy-halo connection.

 For over 30 years, the Magneto-Rotational Instability has been accepted as the mechanism driving accretion disk turbulence. Its physical basis is well understood, where an interplay between centrifugal forces and magnetic tension transfers angular momentum between oppositely displaced fluid elements. In this work, we revisit this picture in global disk models and various magnetic field topologies and generalise it to non-axisymmetric instabilities like the Super-Alfvénic Rotational Instability (SARI). We use the open-source \texttt{Legolas} software to quantify all complex-valued linear eigenfunctions for the (near-)eigenmodes and visualise the resulting spatio-temporal variations in real space in a manner that can be compared to direct numerical simulations of disks. The field perturbations are fundamentally different between the (axisymmetric) MRI and the novel, ultra-localised SARI modes, which bear some resemblance to spiral modes in galaxies but differ in important ways. We use a combined numerical-analytical approach to study the polarization of the magnetic and velocity field perturbations. Finally, we compare disks of differing magnetic topology where many linear modes are merely superposed to recreate a visual impression of `turbulent' fields and quantify the resulting stresses. We find that even superposed, still linearly growing SARI modes can already provide the needed effective viscosity-related alpha-values invoked for angular momentum transport. 3D views on the magnetic field perturbations show that SARI modes of opposite azimuthal mode number may naturally introduce plasmoid and toroidal flux-tube like field deformations.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to characterize the multi-phase gas in the SPT2349-56 protocluster at z=4.3, known to host one of the most starbursting and AGN-rich high redshift this http URL this purpose we conducted APEX single dish observations of the [CII]158 micron (hereafter [CII]) line towards the Core and North components, previously imaged with the ALMA 12-m array. We also present the first [OIII]88 micron (hereafter [OIII]) line observations in such high redshift protocluster system. We obtain a [CII] line luminosity $\sim$1.7$\times$ more than the one recovered by ALMA towards the Core, while remarkably we recover 4$\times$ more [CII] line emission than the one found in deep ALMA images towards the North component, suggesting that the most massive gas reservoirs lie in the less extreme regions of this protocluster system. A minimum ionised gas mass of $\mathrm M_{\rm min}(H^+)$$ \sim$$3.7\times 10^{10}$\,\Msun\, is deduced from the [OIII] line, amounting to 30\% of the molecular gas mass in the same area. Finally we obtain star formation rate (SFR) estimates using the [OIII] line luminosity, and the corresponding ionised gas mass. These yield values that can surpass the far-IR continuum-derived SFR (under the assumption of a standard stellar IMF), which can be reconciled only if non-stellar ionising sources contribute to the [OIII] line luminosity, or a top-heavy stellar IMF produces a larger fraction of O stars per total stellar mass, a distinct possibility in High-Energy-Particle (HEP) rather than (UV-photon)-dominated environments in clusters. Future work using far-IR fine-structure and molecular/neutral-atomic lines is necessary for determining the thermal/ionisation states of the multi-phase medium and these line ratios must be measured over a wide range of spatial scales, which ultimately requires combining wide-field single-dish and high resolution interferometric observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion shocks are thought to play a crucial role in the early stages of star and planet formation, but their direct observational evidence remains elusive, particularly regarding the molecular tracers of these processes. In this work, we searched for features of accretion shocks by observing the emission of SO and SO$_2$ using ALMA in Band 6 towards nearby Class I protostars. We analyze the SO and SO$_2$ emission from Oph IRS 63, DK Cha, and L1527, which have different disk inclination angles, ranging from nearly face-on to edge-on. SO emission is found to be concentrated in rings at the centrifugal barriers of the infalling envelopes. These rings are projected onto the plane of the sky as ellipses or parallel slabs, depending on the inclination angles. Spiral-like streamers with SO emission are also common, with warm ($T_{\rm ex} > 50$ K) and even hot ($T_{\rm ex} \gtrsim 100$ K) spots or segments of SO$_2$ observed near the centrifugal barriers. Inspired by these findings, we present a model that consistently explains the accretion shock traced by SO and SO$_2$, where the shock occurs primarily in two regions: (1) the centrifugal barriers, and (2) the surface of the disk-like inner envelope outside the centrifugal barrier. The outer envelope gains angular momentum through outflows, causing it to fall onto the midplane at or outside the centrifugal barrier, leading to a disk-like inner envelope that is pressure-confined by the accretion shock and moves in a rotating-and-infalling motion. We classify the streamers into two types--those in the midplane and those off the midplane. These streamers interact with the inner envelopes in different ways, resulting in different patterns of shocked regions. We suggest that the shock-related chemistry at the surfaces of the disk and the disk-like inner envelope warrants further special attention.
