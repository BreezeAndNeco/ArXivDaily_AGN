 - **Abstract**
 Over the past three decades, a lot of coronal fast-mode waves were detected by space missions, but their counterparts in the chromosphere, called the Moreton waves, were rarely captured. How this happens remains a mystery. Here, to shed light on this problem, we investigate the photospheric vector magnetograms of the Moreton wave events associated with M- and X-class solar flares in 2010--2023. The H$\alpha$ data are taken with the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) and the Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE). Our statistical results show that more than 80\% of the events occur at the edge of active regions and propagate non-radially due to asymmetric magnetic fields above the flares. According to the reconstructed magnetic field and atmospheric model, Moreton waves propagate in the direction along which the horizontal fast-mode wave speed drops the fastest. The result supports that the inclined magnetic configuration of the eruption is crucial to generate Moreton waves, even for X-class flares. It may explain the low occurrence rate of Moreton waves and why some X-class flares accompanied with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) do not generate Moreton waves.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on radio observations of four magnetars SGR 0501+4516, Swift 1834.9-0846, 1E 1841-045, SGR 1900+14 and a magnetar-like pulsar PSR J1846-0258 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) at 1250 MHz. Notably, PSR J1846-0258 was observed one month after its 2020 X-ray outburst. The data from these observations were searched for periodic emissions and single pulses. No radio emission was detected for any of our targets. After accounting for the effect of red noise, the non-detections yield stringent upper limits on the radio flux density, with $S_{1250} \leq 16.9\, \mu $Jy for the four magnetars and the magnetar-like pulsar, along with constraints on single-pulse flux densities. Our deep radio observations suggest that these magnetars and the magnetar-like pulsar are indeed radio-quiet sources or unfavorably beamed. The resulting flux upper limits, along with previous findings, are discussed, highlighting the significance of further radio observations of radio-quiet magnetars and the high-B magnetar-like pulsar.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), the gravitationally lensed rings around the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in Messier 87 (M87) and Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) have now been successfully imaged at a resolution under 10 gravitational radii (R$_{\rm g}$ $ = \rm{GM/c^2}$). To expand studies beyond M87 and Sgr A*, we have constructed the Event Horizon and Environs (ETHER) sample, a comprehensive database encompassing approximately 3.15 million SMBH mass estimates, $\sim$ 20,000 Very-Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) radio flux densities, and $\sim$ 36,000 hard X-ray flux densities. This database is designed to identify and optimize target selection for the EHT and its upgrades on the ground and in space. We have identified a Gold Sample (GS) of nearby low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) within it that are ideal for studying jet bases and potentially imaging black hole shadows. We observed 27 of these AGNs using the EHT from 2022 to 2024, providing an opportunity to resolve and image accretion flows and jets at resolutions of $\leq$ 100 R$_{\rm g}$. Only a few SMBHs have sufficiently high enough flux density to be imaged at scales of $\leq$ 50 R$_{\rm g}$ with the present EHT. Among these are M87, Sgr A*, NGC4594 (Sombrero/M104), NGC4261, and NGC4374 (Messier 84/M84). Of these, NGC4261, Sombrero, and M84 have been observed and/or are scheduled for deep imaging with EHT+ALMA from 2023 to 2025. Sombrero, NGC4261, M84, NGC4278, and NGC5232 are clearly detected in our EHT+ALMA observations in 2022, indicating that the 230 GHz flux density from the accretion flows is significantly high. Ongoing imaging of the ETHER GS will enable measurements of black hole mass and spin, help constrain General Relativity, and enrich our understanding of jet launching and accretion inflows across a broad multi-parameter space, including black hole mass, spin, accretion rate, and orientation.

 - **Abstract**
 Nanoflares are believed to be key contributors to heating solar non-flaring active regions, though their individual detection remains challenging. This study uses a data-driven field-aligned hydrodynamic model to examine nanoflare properties throughout the lifecycle of AR12758. We simulate coronal loop emissions, where each loop is heated by random nanoflares depending on the loop parameters derived from photospheric magnetograms observed by SDO/HMI. Simulated X-ray flux and temperature can reproduce the temporal variations observed by Chandrayaan-2/XSM. Our findings show that high-frequency nanoflares contribute to cool emissions across the AR, while low- and intermediate- frequency primarily contribute to hot emissions. During the emerging phase, energy deposition is dominated by low-frequency events. Post-emergence, energy is deposited by both low- and intermediate-frequency nanoflares, while as the AR ages, the contribution from intermediate- and high-frequency nanoflares increases. The spatial distribution of heating frequencies across the AR reveals a clear pattern: the core of the active region spends most of its time in a low-frequency heating state, the periphery is dominated by high-frequency heating, and the region between the core and periphery experiences intermediate-frequency heating.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an observational study of the S284-RE region, a low-metallicity area associated with the extended S284 HII region. A thermally supercritical filament (mass $\sim$2402 $M_{\odot}$, length $\sim$8.5 pc) is investigated using the Herschel column density map. The Spitzer ratio 4.5 $\mu$m/3.6 $\mu$m map traces the H$_{2}$ outflows in this filament, where previously reported young stellar objects (YSOs) are spatially distributed. Analysis of the YSO distribution has revealed three active star-forming clusters (YCl1, YCl2, YCl3) within the filament. YCl3 seems to be the most evolved, YCl2 the youngest, while YCl1 displays signs of non-thermal fragmentation. The JWST (F470N+F444W)/F356W ratio map reveals at least seven bipolar H$_{2}$ outflows, with four (olc1--olc4) in YCl1 and three (ol1--ol3) in YCl2. The driving sources of these outflows are identified based on outflow geometry, ALMA continuum peaks, and YSO positions. Two ALMA continuum sources, #2 and #3, from the $M$-$R_{\rm eff}$ plot are recognized as potential massive star formation candidates. The ALMA continuum source #2 hosts at least three outflow-driving sources, whereas the ALMA continuum source #3 contains two. The bipolar outflow olc1, driven by an embedded object within the continuum source #2, is likely a massive protostar, as indicated by Br-$\alpha$ and PAH emissions depicted in the JWST (F405N+F444W)/F356W ratio map. The presence of H$_{2}$ knots in the outflows olc1 and ol1 suggests episodic accretion. Overall, the study investigates a massive protostar candidate, driving the $\sim$2.7 pc H$_{2}$ outflow olc1 and undergoing episodic accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 MUDEHaR is an on-going multi-epoch photometric survey with two narrow filters in H$\alpha$ and the calcium triplet window that uses the T80Cam wide-field imager at the JAST/T80 telescope at Spanish Javalambre astronomical observatory. It is obtaining 100 epochs/year per field for 20 fields in the Galactic disk, each of 2\,deg$^2$, for a total of 40\,deg$^2$. Focused on stellar clusters and HII regions including bright stars, its main objective is to detect tens of thousands OB stars that present emission variability in H$\alpha$ on days-months-years scale. The observed targets include magnetic massive stars, pulsating stars, and all kinds of variable stars. Among our driving scientific objectives of MUDEHaR observations is to identify potential magnetic candidates in massive stars. Only 10--20\,\% of OB stars display a measurable magnetic field, and its origin is still in debate. We outline here the multi-step process involved in identifying OB magnetic stars, highlighting the significance of MUDEHaR observations in this process.
#### Evolution of massive black hole in galactic nucleus

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a scenario for mass evolution of massive black holes (MBH) in galactic nuclei, to explain both the mass correlation of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) with the bulge and the down-sizing behavior of the active galactic nuclei. Primordial gas structures to evolve galactic bulges are supposed to be formed at $z \sim$ 10 and the core region, called the nuclear region (NR) here, is considered to be a place for a MBH to grow to the SMBH. The down-sizing behavior requires the MBH to significantly increase the mass in a time $\sim$ 1 Gyr. The rapid mass increase is discussed to be realized only when the MBH stays in a very high density region such as a core of a molecular cloud throughout the period $\sim$ 1 Gyr. According to these arguments, the MBHs formed from the population III stars born in the mini halos at $z \sim$ 20 - 30 are excluded from the candidates for the seed black hole to the SMBH and only the MBHs from the population II stars born in the core of the central molecular cloud (CMC) in the NR remain as them. The MBHs in the dense core of the CMC started increasing the mass through mass-accretion and the most massive black hole (MMBH) got the most rapid evolution, possibly restraining relatively slow evolutions of the less massive black holes. Dynamical interactions of the MMBH with the ambient MCs induced the wandering motion and the further mass-increase. However, when the MMBH mass exceeded a boundary mass, the dynamical friction with the field stars brakes the MMBH wandering and the mass accretion. This scenario can semi-quantitatively reproduce both the down-sizing behavior and the SMBH mass - bulge mass correlation with reasonable parameter values.
#### SgrA* spin and mass estimates through the detection of multiple extremely large mass-ratio inspirals

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the parameter estimation accuracy that can be achieved for the mass and spin of SgrA*, the SMBH in our Galactic Center, by detecting multiple extremely large mass-ratio inspirals (XMRIs). XMRIs are formed by brown dwarfs (BD) inspiraling into a supermassive black hole (SMBH), thus emitting gravitational waves (GWs) inside the detection band of future space-based detectors such as LISA and TianQin. Theoretical estimates suggest the presence of approximately 10 XMRIs emitting detectable GWs, making them some of the most promising candidates for space-based GW detectors. Our analysis indicates that even if individual sources have low SNRs ($\approx10$), high-precision parameter estimates can still be achieved by detecting multiple sources. In this case, the accuracy of the parameter estimates increases by approximately one to two orders of magnitude, at least. Moreover, by analyzing a small sample of 400 initial conditions for XMRIs formed in the Galactic Center, we estimate that almost 80 % of the detectable XMRIs orbiting SgrA* will have eccentricities between 0.43 to 0.95 and an SNR$\in [10,100]$. The remaining $\sim$20 % of the sources have an SNR$\in [100,1000]$ and eccentricities ranging from 0.25 to 0.92. Additionally, some XMRIs with high SNR are far from being circular. These loud sources with SNR$\approx 1000$ can have eccentricities as high as $e\approx0.7$; although their detection chances are low, representing $\lesssim$2 % of the detectable sources, their presence is not ruled out.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pleiades is the most prominent open star cluster visible from Earth and an important benchmark for simple stellar populations, unified by common origin, age, and distance. Binary stars are its essential ingredient, yet their contribution remains uncertain due to heavy observational biases. A resolved multiplicity survey was conducted for a magnitude-limited G < 15mag sample of 423 potential cluster members, including sources with poorly fitted astrometric solutions in Gaia DR3. Speckle interferometric observations at the 2.5 meter telescope of SAI MSU observatory were combined with Gaia data, enabling the identification of 61 resolved binary or multiple systems within the 0.04 - 10 arcsec (5 - 1350 au) separation range. With speckle observations, we discovered 21 components in 20 systems. The existence of a Merope (23 Tau) companion is confirmed after several previous unsuccessful attempts. We show that the Gaia multipeak fraction is a strong predictor of subarcsecond multiplicity, as all sources with ipd_frac_multi_peak > 4% are successfully resolved. We found that 10% of Pleiades stars have a companion with a mass ratio q > 0.5 within projected separation of 27 < s < 1350 au, and confirm a deficit of wide binaries with s > 300 au. An observed dearth of wide pairs with large mass ratio (q > 0.55) may imprint the transition from hard to soft binaries regime at the early stages of cluster evolution. The total binary fraction for q > 0.5 systems is extrapolated to be around 25%.
#### Hint at an axion-like particle from GRB 221009A

 - **Abstract**
 The detection by the LHAASO Collaboration of the gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A at redshift $z = 0.151$ with energies up to $(13-18) \, \rm TeV$ challenges conventional physics. Photons emitted with energies above $10 \, \rm TeV$ at this redshift can hardly be observed on Earth due to their interaction with the extragalactic background light (EBL). We show that indeed the LHAASO Collaboration should not have observed photons with energies above $10 \, \rm TeV$ if the state-of-the-art EBL model by Saldana-Lopez et al. is taken into account. A problem therefore arises: the Universe should be more transparent than currently believed. We also show that the issue is solved if we introduce the interaction of photons with axion-like particles (ALPs). ALPs are predicted by String Theory, are among the best candidates for dark matter and can produce spectral and polarization effects on astrophysical sources in the presence of external magnetic fields. In particular, for GRB 221009A, photon-ALP oscillations occur within the crossed magnetized media, i.e. the host galaxy, the extragalactic space, the Milky Way, partially reducing the EBL absorption to a level that explains the LHAASO detection of GRB 221009A and its observed spectrum without the need of contrived choices of parameter values, which are instead compulsory within proposed emission models within conventional physics. This fact regarding GRB 221009A represents a strong hint at the ALP existence, which adds to two other indications coming from blazars, a class of active galactic nuclei.
