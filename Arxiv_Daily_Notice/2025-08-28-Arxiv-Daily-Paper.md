#### FRB 20200428 and potentially associated hard X-ray bursts: Maser emission and synchrotron radiation of electrons in a weakly magnetized plasma?

 - **Abstract**
 The temporal and spatial coincidence between FRB 20200428 and hard peaks of the X-ray burst from SGR 1935+2154 suggests their potential association. We attributed them to the plasma synchrotron maser emission and synchrotron radiation of electrons in weakly magnetized, relativistically moving plasma blobs, and Monte Carlo simulation analysis shows that our model can predict observable fast radio burst outbursts and associated hard X-ray bursts with current telescopes. We constrained the properties of the blobs, including the Lorentz factor $\Gamma=5-30$, the magnetization factor $\sigma=6\times10^{-5}\sim 2\times 10^{-4}$, the electron Lorentz factor $\gamma_{\rm e,s}=(1.8-3.3)\times10^4$, and the plasma frequency $\nu_P=2.48 -42.61$ MHz. The inferred size of the blobs is $\sim 10^{9-10}$ cm, and it is located $\sim 10^{12-14}$ cm from the central engine. By adopting fine-tuned parameter sets, the observed spectra of both the FRB 20200428 outbursts and X-ray bursts can be well represented. The peak flux density ($F_{\rm\nu_{ pk}}$) of plasma maser emission is sensitive to $\sigma$ and $\nu_P$. Variation in $F_{\rm \nu_{pk}}$ can be more than 10 orders of magnitude, while the flux density of the synchrotron emission only varies by $1-2$ orders of magnitude. This can account for the observed sub-energetic radio bursts or giant radio pulses from SGR 1935+2154.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 6302 is a spectacular bipolar planetary nebula (PN) whose spectrum exhibits fast outflows and highly ionized emission lines, indicating the presence of a very hot central star (~220,000 K). Its infrared spectrum reveals a mixed oxygen and carbon dust chemistry, displaying both silicate and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features. Using the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, a mosaic map was obtained over the core of NGC 6302, covering the wavelength range of 5--28 micron and spanning an area of ~18.5 arcsec x15 arcsec. The spatially resolved spectrum reveals ~200 molecular and ionized lines from species requiring ionisation potentials of up to 205 eV. The spatial distributions highlight a complex structure at the nebula's centre. Highly ionized species such as Mg VII and Si VII show compact structures, while lower-ionization species such as H^+ extend much farther outwards, forming filament-defined rims that delineate a bubble. Within the bubble, the H^+ and H_2 emission coincide, while the PAH emission appears farther out, indicating an ionization structure distinct from typical photodissociation regions, such as the Orion Bar. This may be the first identification of a PAH formation site in a PN. This PN appears to be shaped not by a steady, continuous outflow, but by a series of dynamic, impulsive bubble ejections, creating local conditions conducive to PAH formation. A dusty torus surrounds the core, primarily composed of large (micron-sized) silicate grains with crystalline components. The long-lived torus contains a substantial mass of material, which could support an equilibrium chemistry and a slow dust-formation process.

 - **Abstract**
 Reconstructing the star formation history (SFH) of disk galaxies is central to understanding their growth and evolution, yet such estimates can be strongly biased by stellar radial migration - the redistribution of angular momenta over cosmic time. Using 186 Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) analogues from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, we compare star formation rates (SFRs) inferred from present-day stellar positions with those based on stellar birth radii to quantify the magnitude, spatial structure, and temporal evolution of migration-induced biases. We find that radial migration systematically produces artificial star formation in regions that had not yet formed stars. Notably, about 80% of galaxies exhibit outer-disk stars older than 10 Gyr, implying that these populations must have migrated from the inner disk. Similar effects appear in about 45% of galaxies at intermediate radii during early epochs, and in 30% of quenched inner disks within the past 4 Gyr. Migration also smooths SFHs, washing out localized bursts and periods of suppressed star formation by dispersing stars across neighboring radii. The strength and imprint of these distortions depend sensitively on galactic structure and evolutionary history: strong bars drive mean SFR overestimates of up to 75% in the inner disk and 150% in the outskirts; thinner, dynamically cold disks suffer average outer-disk biases up to 160%; while thick disks exhibit typical inner-disk biases up to 125%. Merger timing further modulates these patterns. Our results demonstrate that failing to account for stellar migration can lead to severe misinterpretations of when and where stars formed, with direct implications for the chemical and evolutionary histories of the MW and external galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a series of simulations of magnetised Binary Neutron Star mergers, with varying magnetic field topologies in the initial data, as well as varying Equations of State, and mass ratios. In this paper, a companion paper to arXiv:2506.18995, we analyse the impact of the initial field configuration on the gravitational wave signal, the amplification of the magnetic field, and the ejected material. We investigate the dependence of the phase evolution of the gravitational wave in the post-merger on the initial magnetic field, finding that dephasing between the $(\ell=2,m=2)$ mode of the gravitational wave, and the $(2,1)$ and $(3,3)$ modes may be strongly impacted by the numerical reconstruction scheme. The magnetic field amplification during the Kelvin-Helmholtz dominated phase may be considerably enhanced by anti-aligned fields, or suppressed by toroidal fields. The post-merger amplification of the field due to winding may be suppressed by toroidal fields, and enhanced by asymmetries or mixtures of poloidal and toroidal fields. The field strength in the ejecta may be impacted by the initial magnetic field, with configurations which lead to large amplifications and those with mixtures of poloidal and toroidal fields preferentially emitting highly magnetised material in the polar regions, showing a weaker dependence of the magnetic field on the density of the ejecta than in cases that amplify the magnetic field less. We find that the magnetic field is largely randomly oriented in the ejected material, supporting such models used to estimate thermalisation timescales of ejected material. We find that configurations which begin with an initial bitant symmetry break this symmetry uniformly, independent of the initial configuration, when evolved without an enforced symmetry. This behaviour suggests the presence of a spontaneous symmetry breaking bifurcation in the solution.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the emergence of magnetic fields is essential for understanding the physical mechanisms behind various phenomena in the solar atmosphere. Most importantly, the emerging fields offer valuable insights into how energy and mass are transferred to the upper solar atmosphere. As a result, they have garnered significant attention from both observational and theoretical perspectives. In this article, we present two models of quiet-Sun-like magnetic fields generated by the Bifrost code. We compare these models with observations from the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope (SST) and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). By tracking the magnetic features in both the SST and Bifrost data, we determine the similarities and differences between the fields identified in the models and those observed. We conduct a quantitative comparison of various properties, such as flux content, flux densities, horizontal and line-of-sight velocities, lifetimes, sizes, and surface interactions. Additionally, we identify and analyze the properties of the largest emerging bipoles in the SST and Bifrost data. Our findings indicate that the magnetic bipoles in the Bifrost simulations are generally stronger than those observed with the SST. However, a qualitative comparison of the chromospheric and transition region responses to the emerging fields in the Bifrost models, SST, and IRIS observations shows similar heating processes occurring above and around the emerging fields. Finally, we outline our plans for future work aimed at studying the emergence of magnetic fields in the quiet Sun, with a particular focus on the chromosphere and upper atmospheric layers.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a group of field dwarf galaxies which includes on-the-fly radiative transfer (RT) and is evolved to $z=0$. Emission from stars is included according to age-dependent spectra, and a redshift-dependent UV background. The inclusion of RT results in the formation of eight additional faint dwarf galaxies with stellar masses of $10^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$ to several $10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ and only old stellar populations, similar to the observed Ultra-Faint Dwarf galaxies. They formed before and during cosmic reionisation and were mostly quenched by $z \sim 3-4$. The simulated galaxies follow many observed scaling relations such as the stellar mass-halo mass relation, the mass-size relation, and the luminosity-velocity dispersion relation. For the more massive dwarf galaxies, radiative feedback suppresses star formation, making it less bursty and reducing explosive outflows. This consequently reduces the dark matter core sizes by a factor of 2-3, rendering the core sizes ($\sim$ 1 kpc) more consistent with observations. The distribution of HI in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is ubiquitous with a covering fraction of unity within $R_{vir}$, in good agreement with observations. It is rather insensitive to radiative or SN feedback at $z=0$, but at $z>5$ it is much higher in the RT simulation. In contrast, the distribution of low ions like SiII is very compact and declines sharply beyond the ISM scale. CIV and OVI have a more extended distribution, but their column densities are generally below the detection limit. Radiative feedback leads to smaller column densities of the metal ions, partly due to the reduction of total metal production, and partly because hard photons from the stellar radiation escape the ISM and further ionise the CGM. The abundance of CIV is particularly sensitive to the latter effect.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: This research presents unsupervised machine learning and statistical methods to identify and analyze tidal tails in open star clusters using data from the Gaia-DR3 catalog. Aims: We aim to identify member stars, detect and analyze tidal tails in five open clusters, BH 164, Alessi 2, NGC 2281, NGC 2354, and M67, of ages between 60 Myr and 4 Gyr. These clusters were selected based on the previous evidence of extended tidal structures. Methods: We utilized machine learning algorithms such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), along with statistical methods to analyze the kinematic, photometric, and astrometric properties of stars. Key characteristics of tidal tails, including radial velocity, color-magnitude diagram, and spatial projections in the tangent plane beyond the cluster's Jacobi radius ($r_J$), were used to detect them. We used N-body simulations to visualize and compare the observables with real data. Further analysis was done on the detected cluster and tail stars to study their internal dynamics and populations, including binary fraction. We also applied the residual velocity method to detect rotational patterns in the clusters and their tails. Results: We identified tidal tails in all five clusters, with detected tails extending farther in some clusters and containing significantly more stars than previously reported (tails ranging from 40 to 100 pc, one to four times the Jacobi radius, with 100 - 200 tail stars). The luminosity functions of the tails and their parent clusters were generally consistent, and tails lacked massive stars. In general, the binary fraction was found to be higher in the tidal tails. Significant rotation was detected in M67 and NGC 2281 for the first time.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar population properties are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution. Their inference for statistically representative samples requires deep multi-object spectroscopy, typically obtained with fiber-fed spectrographs that integrate only a fraction of galaxy light. The most comprehensive local Universe dataset is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), whose fibers typically collected ~30% of total flux. Stellar population gradients, ubiquitously present in galaxies, systematically bias SDSS toward central properties, by amounts yet to be quantified. We leverage CALIFA integral-field spectroscopy to simulate fiber-fed observations at redshifts z=0.005-0.4, accounting for seeing effects. We analyze systematic aperture correction trends across galaxy morphologies and derive correction recipes based on: fiber-measured indices, global g-r color, absolute r-band magnitude Mr, and physical half-light radius R50. Corrections for absorption indices typically reach >~15% of their dynamical range at z~0.02, decreasing to ~7% at z~0.1 (median SDSS redshift) and becoming negligible above z~0.2. Spiral galaxies exhibit the largest aperture effects due to their strong internal gradients. Our correction recipes, applied to the SDSS-DR7 dataset, significantly reduce scatter in stellar population diagnostic planes and enhance bimodality in age-sensitive diagrams. Corrections reveal systematic overestimates of old galaxy fractions by up to 10% and an underestimate by >~0.2 mag of the transition luminosity at which old galaxies become dominant. Aperture corrections significantly impact observational tracers of stellar populations from fiber spectroscopy. Absorption indices corrections applied to SDSS-DR7 will provide a robust local benchmark for galaxy evolution studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological models of hierarchical structure formation predict the existence of a widespread population of dual accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on kpc-scale separations, corresponding to projected distances < 0".8 at redshifts higher than 0.5. However, close companions to known active galactic nuclei (AGN) or quasars (QSOs) can also be multiple images of the object itself, strongly lensed by a foreground galaxy, as well as foreground stars in a chance superposition. Thanks to its large sky coverage, sensitivity, and high spatial resolution, Euclid offers a unique opportunity to obtain a large, homogeneous sample of dual/lensed AGN candidates with sub-arcsec projected separations. Here we present a machine learning approach, in particular a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to identify close companions to known QSOs down to separations of $\sim\,$0".15 comparable to the Euclid VIS point spread function (PSF). We studied the effectiveness of the CNN in identifying dual AGN and demonstrated that it outperforms traditional techniques. Applying our CNN to a sample of $\sim\,$6000 QSOs from the Q1 Euclid data release, we find a fraction of about 0.25% dual AGN candidates with separation $\sim\,$0".4 (corresponding to $\sim$3 kpc at z=1). Estimating the foreground contamination from stellar objects, we find that most of the pair candidates with separation higher than 0".5 are likely contaminants, while below this limit, contamination is expected to be less than 20%. For objects at higher separation (>0".5, i.e. 4 kpc at z=1), we performed PSF subtraction and used colour-colour diagrams to constrain their nature. We present a first set of dual/lensed AGN candidates detected in the Q1 Euclid data, providing a starting point for the analysis of future data releases.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio relics, arc-like polarized sources with highly aligned magnetic fields, are typically found on the outskirts of merging galaxy clusters. The magneto-ionic media responsible for the significant coherence observed in radio relics remain poorly understood. Low-frequency measurements of radio relics are essential for constraining depolarization models, which provide crucial insights into the magnetic field distribution. However, these measurements are challenging due to the emission properties and interferometer systematics. We have detected polarization signals from the northwest radio relic in Abell 746 at 650 MHz with the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, marking the first-ever detection of polarisation from radio relics below 1 GHz. At this frequency, the average Rotation Measure (RM) corrected magnetic fields align well with shock radio emission, typical of radio relics. The fractional polarization at 650 MHz is $\sim 18\pm4 \%$. Our results indicate that a single internal depolarization model cannot explain the observed depolarization spectra, suggesting a non-uniform magnetic field distribution or complex contribution of different polarized regions in the radio relic. Our detection of polarization signals at 650 MHz reveals critical insights into radio relic magnetic field structures, offering a low-frequency approach to understanding ICM magnetic fields in merging galaxy clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Coherent, periodic radio emission from pulsars has been widely interpreted as evidence of neutron stars as strongly magnetized compact objects. In recent years, radio pulses have also been detected from white dwarfs (WDs) in tight binary systems, raising the question of whether isolated WDs could similarly host pulsar-like emission. We conducted the most sensitive search to date for coherent radio signals from five isolated, rapidly rotating, and magnetized WDs, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). No pulsed or continuum radio emission was detected down to $\mu$Jy levels. These non-detections place the most stringent observational constraints yet on the existence of isolated WD pulsars. Our results suggest that either such emission is intrinsically weak, narrowly beamed, or requires binary-induced magnetospheric interactions absent in solitary systems. Comparison with the known radio-emitting WDs highlights the critical role of companion interaction in enabling detectable emission. This work expands on prior surveys by targeting sources with the most favorable physical conditions for WD pulsar-like activity and employing highly sensitive, targeted observations. Future observations with next-generation facilities such as the SKA will be essential to explore fainter or sporadic emission from massive, magnetic WDs and to investigate their potential as compact radio transients further.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) have revealed abundant reservoirs of neutral hydrogen (HI) in low redshift post-starburst galaxies (PSBs), raising the question of why star formation ceases rapidly in these systems. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of the shape of the integrated HI spectra of 67 PSBs. We find that PSBs exhibit significantly higher HI spectral concentration values ($K$) compared to a matched sample from xGASS, and are more comparable to those of starburst galaxies. By extending our analysis to spatially resolved HI data from THINGS and ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$, we show that both centrally concentrated HI distributions and dynamically unsettled HI can effectively increase $K$, while non-axisymmetric structures only contribute to the scatter of the $K$ distribution. Distinguishing between central concentration and dynamically unsettled gas as the origin of high $K$ can be achieved by measuring the spectral asymmetry ($A_{\rm F}$), making the $K$-$A_{\rm F}$ plane a powerful diagnostic tool for identifying galaxies with unsettled HI using integrated spectra alone. Based on their location in the $K$-$A_{\rm F}$ plane, we find that most PSBs are not dominated by unsettled HI, but rather exhibit elevated central gas concentration. Both modes of gas redistribution in PSBs may eventually contribute to their quenching.
#### Gravitational Microlensing of the Galactic Centre $γ$-Ray Excess: A New Test for Point-Like or Extended Emission?

 - **Abstract**
 We present a potential test of the origin of the $\gamma$-ray Galactic Centre Excess (GCE). We demonstrate how gravitational microlensing by stellar mass objects along the line of sight to the Galactic Bulge can distinguish between the possibility of extensive emission due to dark matter self-annihilation from more prosaic astrophysical sources, namely millisecond pulsars. Such an astrophysical origin would result in emission from a population of small, currently unresolved point-like sources - in contrast to the expected smoother emission resulting from dark matter annihilation. Given that the scale of gravitational microlensing, that is, the Einstein radius for stellar mass lenses, and hence, the degree of induced magnification, is sensitive to the size of the emitting region, such microlensing will induce time variability in the emission of astrophysical sources, whereas $\gamma$-ray emission from dark matter annihilation will effectively be immune to such influences. However, we find that detecting microlensing-induced variability requires significantly greater sensitivity than that of current or planned $\gamma$-ray detectors. For a small population of bright GCE sources, more than an order-of-magnitude increase in effective area over Fermi-LAT would be required, with events remaining extremely rare. For a large population of faint sources, events would occur multiple times a year, but would only be detectable with a four-order-of-magnitude improvement. Whilst microlensing might not be a definitive test of the origin of the GCE, in future observations, it may prove useful in determining the properties of any point-like source population.

 - **Abstract**
 We discovered a hyperluminous dust-obscured galaxy with mysterious blue-excess emission (BlueDOG) in rest-frame UV of its spectral energy distribution (SED) from a multi-wavelength survey in the AKARI Deep Field - South (ADF-S). We present the results of SED analysis with multiwavelength photometric data and spectroscopic analysis, observed with Gemini-S/GMOS, FLAMINGOS-2, to explore the origin of blue-excess emission of a hyperluminous BlueDOG, ADFS-KMTDOG-102, at z=2.6. The SED analysis shows that this BlueDOG is a highly massive system (log $M_{*}$/$M_\odot=12.3$) with substantial extinction. Additionally, the proportion of the old stellar population exceeds that of the young stellar population, which suggests stellar evolution cumulated from the early universe. The mass of supermassive black hole (SMBH) estimated using the extinction-corrected broad H$\rm\alpha$ emission line yields log $M_{\rm BH}$/$M_\odot$=10.2. We discuss the similarity between the BlueDOG and 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), recently discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope, showing SED shapes remarkably similar to those of LRDs. The UV emission line ratios indicate that the emission lines are primarily powered by the central active galactic nuclei (AGN). In contrast, the origin of the blue-excess UV continuum remains ambiguous, since both recent star formation and AGN-induced scattered light are viable explanations, based on the results from the SED fitting and scattered light modeling.

 We present a multi-wavelength study on the mini-outburst of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630 to investigate the origin of its optical emission. Using the X-ray data from Insight-HXMT and the optical observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory, we find a powerlaw correlation between the optical and X-ray fluxes with slopes of about 0.4, indicating a hybrid contribution to the optical emission from both viscously heated disk and irradiation of the outer disk illuminated by the inner X-ray emission, but inconsistent with jet-dominated optical emission. Time delay analysis shows that the optical emission precedes the X-ray by about 8.5 days, which can be naturally interpreted by the disk instability model (DIM). Meanwhile, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with an irradiated disk model successfully reproduces the observed optical and X-ray emission, with negligible contribution from the jet. The color-magnitude diagram further supports the disk-dominated optical origin of MAXI J1348-630 during its mini-outburst. Our results suggest that the DIM plays a central role in understanding mini-outbursts of X-ray binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the structural and asteroseismic consequences of mass accretion in massive stars within close binary systems. Using MESA, we model the evolution of the 10 M$_{\odot}$ accretor through and after a Roche lobe overflow phase. In addition to changing the surface composition of the star, mass accretion also significantly modifies the internal structure by expanding the convective core and altering chemical stratification near the core-envelope boundary. This partial core rejuvenation creates a distinct mean molecular weight gradient and leaves a persistent local density modulation. In the late stages of mass transfer, changes in density and sound-speed profiles become apparent and influence stellar oscillations. We analyse the asteroseismic properties of the post-mass transfer models compared to single stars of the same mass and central hydrogen abundance. In the gravity mode regime, the altered Brunt-Väisälä frequency leads to period spacing patterns with larger amplitudes and phase shifts. For low and intermediate-order pressure modes, we find systematic frequency deviations linked to changes in the sound-speed profile. Weight function analyses confirm that these differences arise primarily from structural modifications near the convective core boundary. Furthermore, small frequency separations, sensitive to localised sound-speed gradients, reveal periodic variations attributable to the density discontinuity at the convective core edge. The accretor exhibits a larger sound-speed gradient integral and a longer acoustic radius ratio compared to the single star, consistent with its expanded core. Our results demonstrate that mass accretion imprints measurable asteroseismic signatures on both gravity and pressure modes. These signatures provide powerful diagnostics for identifying post-interaction stars, for refining stellar age and structure estimates in binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel analytical framework employing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to constrain the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ through the analysis of stellar orbits around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A* at the Galactic center. Focusing on the well-observed S2 star, we use an inverse PINN (iPINN) architecture to infer orbital elements and estimate the total precession angle from astrometric data. By isolating the contribution from $\Lambda$, which is defined as the difference between the total precession and the Schwarzschild precession, we derive a stringent upper bound of $\Lambda \leq 5.67 \times 10^{-40}, \mathrm{m}^{-2}$, which is approximately two orders of magnitude tighter than previous estimates obtained using similar data-driven methods. Extension of our analysis to two additional long-period S-stars, S1 and S9, reveals that while the cosmological precession becomes relatively more prominent in such systems, limited orbital coverage introduces significant uncertainties in parameter estimation. Among the cases examined, the constraint derived from S2 remains the most robust. Our results highlight the potential of PINN-based approaches for extracting physical insights from sparse or noisy astronomical data. Future applications to next-generation observational data and further methodological improvements in machine learning are expected to refine the cosmological constraints and enable broader tests of gravitational theories.

 - **Abstract**
 Climate change is inducing a global atmospheric contraction above the tropopause (~10 km), leading to systematic decrease in neutral air density. The impact of climate change on small meteoroids has already been observed over the last two decades, with documented shifts in their ablation altitudes in the mesosphere (~50-85 km) and lower thermosphere (~85-120 km). This study evaluates the potential effect of these changes on meteorite-dropping fireballs, which typically penetrate the stratosphere (~10-50 km). As a case study, we simulate the atmospheric entry of the fragile Winchcombe carbonaceous chondrite under projected atmospheric conditions for the year 2100 assuming a moderate future emission scenario. Using a semi-empirical fragmentation and ablation model, we compare the meteoroid's light curve and deceleration under present and future atmospheric density profiles. The results indicate a modest variation of the ablation heights, with the catastrophic fragmentation occurring 300 m lower and the luminous flight terminating 190 m higher. The absolute magnitude peak remains unchanged, but the fireball would appear 0.5 dimmer above ~120 km. The surviving meteorite mass is reduced by only 0.1 g. Our findings indicate that century-scale variations in atmospheric density caused by climate change moderately influence bright fireballs and have a minimal impact on meteorite survival.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology of solar-like oscillations in giant stars allow the derivation of their masses and radii. For members of open clusters, this provides an age of the cluster that should be identical to the one derived from the colour-magnitude diagram, but independent of the uncertainties that are present for that type of analysis. We aim to identify and measure the properties of giant members of the open cluster NGC6633, and combine these with asteroseismic measurements to derive a precise and self-consistent cluster age. Importantly, we wish to constrain the effects of rotational mixing on stellar evolution, since assumptions about internal mixing can have a significant impact on stellar age estimates. We identify five giant members of NGC6633 using photometry and Gaia data, supplemented by spectroscopic literature measurements. These are combined with asteroseismic measurements from CoRoT data and compared to stellar-model isochrones. This constrains the interior mixing to a low level and enables the most precise, accurate and self-consistent age estimate so far for this cluster. Asteroseismology of the giants and the cluster colour-magnitude diagram provide self-consistent masses of the giant members and their radii constrain the stellar interior mixing to a low level. The [C/N] ratios and Li abundances also suggest that rotation has had very little influence on the evolution of the stars in NGC 6633. This results in an age estimate of 0.55+0.05-0.10 Gyr for NGC6633. Four giant members appear to be in the helium-core burning evolutionary phase as also expected from evolutionary timescales. For the largest giant, the evidence remains inconclusive. A comparison to other age and mass estimates for the same stars in the literature uncovers biases for automated age estimates of helium-core burning stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The eight ultra-long period pulsars (ULPPs) in radio bands have been discovered recently, e.g., ASKAP J1935+2148 with a spin period of 53.8\,min, which are much longer than those of normal pulsars, spanning from 0.016\,s to 23.5\,s, however the origins, spin evolutions and emission mechanisms of these sources are still puzzling. We investigate how the ultra-long period of ASKAP J1935+2148 is evolved by the braking of relativistic particle wind, in a time scale of about 0.1 - 1 Myr, from a normal pulsar with local superstrong magnetic fields. In addition, it is noticed that the ULPPs in the period versus period derivative diagram are much below the ``death line", implying their different characteristics from the normal pulsars. Five sources (including ASKAP J1935+2148) in total eight ULPPs share the rotational energy loss rates to be lower than their respective radio emission luminosities, a phenomenon that can be accounted for by the sustainable radio bursts induced through the reconnection of locally concentrated magnetic field this http URL diversity and complexity of ULPP radio emissions should be closely related to the presence of magnetic reconnection rather than rotational powered discharges in the gaps. Furthermore, it is suggested that the coherent radio emissions of pulsars may have two origins, one from the rotation-powered electric voltage that accounts for the normal pulsar phenomena and the other from the magnetic reconnection-induced continual radio bursts that account for the ULPP observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The heating and structure of the solar chromosphere depends on the underlying magnetic field, among other parameters. The lowest magnetic flux of the solar atmosphere is found in the quiet Sun internetwork and is thought to be provided by the small-scale dynamo (SSD) process. We aim to understand the chromospheric structure and dynamics in a simulation with purely SSD generated magnetic fields. We perform a 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic (rMHD) simulation of the solar atmosphere, including the necessary physics to simulate the solar chromosphere. No magnetic field is imposed beyond that generated by an SSD process. We analyse the magnetic field in the chromosphere, and the resulting energy balance. Plasma at chromospheric temperatures reaches high into the atmosphere, with small, transient regions reaching coronal temperatures. An average Poynting flux of $5\times10^6~\mathrm{erg\;cm}^{-3}$\;s$^{-1}$ is found at the base of the chromosphere. The magnetic field in the chromosphere falls off more slowly with height than predicted by a potential field extrapolation from the radial component of the photospheric field. Starting in the middle chromosphere, the magnetic energy density is an order of magnitude larger than the kinetic energy density and, in the upper chromosphere, also larger than the thermal energy density. Nonetheless, even in the high chromosphere, the plasma beta in shock fronts and low-field regions can locally reach values above unity. The interactions between shocks and the magnetic field are essential to understanding the dynamics of the internetwork chromosphere. The SSD generated magnetic fields are strong enough to dominate the energy balance in the mid-to-upper chromosphere. The energy flux into the chromosphere is $8.16\times 10^{6}~\mathrm{erg\;cm^{-2}\;s^{-1}}$, larger than the canonical values required to heat the quiet sun chromosphere and corona.
#### HD 44892: The youngest (or oldest?) gas-harbouring debris disc around an intermediate mass star

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detections of gas around a 2.1 Myr old debris disc-bearing intermediate-mass star, HD 44892. Through our analysis we deem the alternative age of 800 Myr unlikely. Gas is detected both in $^{12}$CO (2-1) emission through ALMA Band 6 observations and absorption in Ca II K and H seen with high-resolution UVES spectroscopy. The star exhibits a 12 $\mu$m fractional excess of $7.86^{+0.11}_{-2.27}$, placing it in the transition stage between protoplanetary and debris discs, at a level comparable to HD 141569. Our detection of 1.3 mm emission yields the dust mass of 0.019$\pm$0.009 $M_{\oplus}$ assuming 115 K temperature. Assuming a gas temperature of 20 K, the resulting CO gas mass is (7.86$\pm$2.05)$\times$10$^{-5}$ $M_{\oplus}$. For a warmer gas of 50 K it increases to (1.62$\pm$0.17)$\times$10$^{-4}$ $M_{\oplus}$. From the $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O non-detections we derive upper limits which suggest this CO gas mass estimate should be treated as a lower limit, because the CO emission might be optically thick. From the analysis of UVES spectroscopic data we find variability in the spectrum of HD 44892, in both calcium Ca II K and H lines, which is absent from sodium Na I D1 and D2 lines, and can be interpreted by transiting circumstellar gas. Through comparison to spectra of nearby stars we exclude the possibility of these features being caused by interstellar absorption. Both the dust mass, which is within an order of magnitude of HD 141569, and the gas mass derived here indicate a late gas dispersal stage of the protoplanetary disc.

 - **Abstract**
 During Juno's only flyby of Europa, the Jupiter Energetic Particle Detector Instrument (JEDI) measured complex dropouts in the energetic ion flux in Europa's wake. We investigate the causes of these dropouts, focusing specifically on energetic protons of ~100 keV and ~1 MeV, using back-tracking particle simulations, a prescribed description of Europa's atmosphere and a three-dimensional single fluid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model of the plasma-atmosphere interaction. We investigate the role of magnetic field perturbations resulting from the interaction between Jupiter's magnetospheric plasma and Europa's atmosphere and the presence of field-aligned electron beams in Europa's wake. We compare the simulated effect of the perturbed fields on the pitch angle distributions of the ion losses to Juno-JEDI measurements. We find that at ~100 keV, field perturbations are the dominant factor controlling the distribution of the losses along the flyby, while at ~1 MeV a combination of field perturbations and absorption by the surface due to short half bounce periods is required to explain the measured losses. We also find that the effect of charge-exchange with Europa's tenuous atmosphere is weak and absorption by dust in Europa's environment is negligible. Furthermore, we find that the perturbed magnetic fields which best represent the measurements are those that account for the plasma interaction with a sub-/anti-Jovian asymmetric atmosphere, non-uniform ionization of the atmosphere, and electron beams. This sensitivity to the specific field perturbation demonstrates that combining observations and modeling of proton depletions constitute an important tool to probe the electromagnetic field and atmospheric configurations of Europa.

 - **Abstract**
 A sub-parsec supermassive black hole binary at the center of the galaxy 3C 66B is a promising candidate for continuous gravitational wave searches with Pulsar Timing Arrays. In this work, we search for such a signal in the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. Matching our priors to estimates of binary parameters from electromagnetic observations, we find log Bayes factor of 0.22, highlighting that the source can be neither confirmed nor ruled out. We place upper limits at 95% credibility on the chirp mass $M < 6.05 \times 10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$, and on the characteristic strain amplitude $\textrm{log}_{10}(h_0)< -14.44$. This partially rules out the parameter space suggested by electromagnetic observations of 3C 66B. We also independently reproduce the calculation of the chirp mass with the 3-mm flux monitor data from the unresolved core of 3C 66B. Based on this, we outline a new methodology for constructing a joint likelihood of electromagnetic and gravitational-wave data from supermassive black hole binaries. Finally, we suggest that firmly established SMBHB candidates may be treated as standard sirens for complementary constraints on the universe expansion rate. With this, we obtain constraints on the Hubble constant with 3C 66B.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a joint analysis of HI absorption Zeeman measurements and the morphology of filamentary HI emission to investigate the three-dimensional structure of the magnetic field in the diffuse neutral interstellar medium (ISM). Our analysis is based on the Arecibo Millennium Survey and new data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) toward radio sources 3C 75, 3C 207, and 3C 409. Toward 3C 409, we make a 4$\sigma$ Zeeman detection and infer $B_{LOS}$ = 9.1 +/- 1.9$\mu$G, in agreement with Arecibo results. We quantify the dispersion of HI filaments at the locations and velocities of Zeeman components using GALFA-HI narrow-channel emission maps. Focusing on a subsample of 42 spectrally distinct components, we find a weak but statistically significant positive correlation (Spearman r = 0.3, $p = 0.01$) between $|B_{LOS}|$ and the circular variance of HI filament orientation angles. To examine its origin, we characterize the environments probed by HI absorption using dust emission, 3D dust maps, OH absorption, and CO emission. We find evidence that existing HI absorption Zeeman measurements trace magnetic fields that are coherent on parsec scales, probe primarily local gas ($100$-$500$ pc, often at distances consistent with the Local Bubble wall), and exhibit systematic differences in the magnitude of $B_{LOS}$. We attribute the correlation between Zeeman measurements and filamentary HI morphology to large-scale variations in magnetic field strength and/or inclination angle across different Galactic environments, which could arise due to the Local Bubble geometry or enhanced total field strength in denser regions.

 - **Abstract**
 While the warm, ionized gas in the CGM at z>3 is now routinely observed around bright QSOs in Lya emission, little is known about the CGM hot phase due to its expected faintness in the X-ray band, often referred to as the ICM. Here, we report the analysis of 634 ks of Chandra X-ray observations in the MQN01 Cosmic Node, a region containing one of the brightest Lya nebulae and the largest galaxy overdensity discovered so far at z>3. We detect 66 net counts of X-ray emission in the 0.5-2 keV band extending to at least 30 kpc from the brightest QSO in MQN01. The morphology and spectrum are consistent with thermal emission from hot plasma in CIE. Photoionization is negligible, and IC is disfavored. A joint spatial and spectral MCMC analysis provides consistency with a beta-model with a steep density profile and a gas temperature kT~1.8 keV and virial halo mass Mvir~3e13 Mo. The inferred hot gas mass is Mhot(<Rvir)~2.6e12 Mo, which is ~8.3% of Mvir, or ~56% of the theoretical cosmological baryon budget of the halo. The hot gas also emits an exceptionally high Lx, with a measured L2-10~2.3e45 erg/s within the central 30 kpc. This system is a clear outlier in the Lx-Tx plane, indicating a thermodynamic state distinct from that of evolved lower-redshift hot halos. The cooling time in the inner 15-30 kpc is comparable to the local dynamical time, suggesting that the gas could become locally unstable in the absence of heating or feedback. Moreover, the thermal pressure associated with the detected CGM hot phase is large enough to confine the cold and dense clumps, which are required to reproduce the high Lya emission associated with the inner regions of the MQN01 structure. Although limited to a single system, our results provide unique information on the multi-phase properties of the CGM and a view of the nascent thermal hot gas phase observed in local galaxy clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We have conducted a search for strong gravitational lensing systems in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10 (DR10). This paper is the fourth in a series of searches (following Huang et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2021; Storfer et al. 2024, Paper I, II, & III respectively). This is the first catalog of lens candidates covering nearly the entirety of the extragalactic sky south of declination $\delta\approx +32$ deg, all of it observed by the DECam, covering $\sim$14,000 $deg^2$. We impose a $z$-band magnitude cut of < 20 in AB magnitude. We deploy a Residual Neural Network and EfficientNet as an ensemble trained on a compilation of known lensing systems and high-grade candidates as well as nonlenses in the same footprint. The predictions from these two base models are aggregated using a meta-learner. After applying our ensemble to the survey data, we exclude known candidates and systems, and use our own visual inspection portal to rank images in the top 0.01 percentile of all neural network recommendations. We have found 811 new lens candidates. These include 484 new candidates in the Legacy Surveys DR9 footprint, all parts of which have been searched for strong lenses at least once before, either by our group or others. Combining the discoveries from this work with those from Paper I (335), II (1210), and III (1512), we have discovered a total of 3868 new candidates in the DESI Legacy Surveys.
