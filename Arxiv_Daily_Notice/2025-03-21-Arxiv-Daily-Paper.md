 - **Abstract**
 We present the early data release (EDR) of SAPPHIRES, a JWST Cycle-3 Treasury imaging and spectroscopic survey using the powerful NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopic (WFSS) mode in pure parallel. SAPPHIRES will obtain NIRCam imaging and WFSS data in many cosmological deep fields totaling a telescope charged time of 709 hours (557-hour exposures). In this EDR, we present NIRCam imaging and WFSS data obtained in parallel to the Frontier Field galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403, which are attached to primary observations JWST-GO-4750. With a total dual-channel exposure time of 47.2 hours, we obtain deep NIRCam imaging in 13 bands at 0.6--5.0 micron and deep WFSS at 3.1-5.0 micron through the F356W and F444W filters with grisms in orthogonal dispersion directions. We release reduced NIRCam images, photometric catalogs of 22107 sources and WFSS spectra of 1060 sources with confirmed redshifts ($z\simeq0-8.5$). Preliminary value-added catalogs including photometric redshifts, spectroscopic redshifts and physical properties (mass, star-formation rate, etc.) are also made available. We also characterize the data quality and demonstrate scientific applications, including (1) galaxy candidates at the redshift frontier ($z\gtrsim10$), (2) the ionized gas kinematics of a galaxy reconstructed from $R\sim1500$ grism spectra at orthogonal dispersion directions, (3) massive emission-line galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) around the Epoch of Reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a remarkably large and luminous line-emitting nebula extending on either side of the Balmer-break galaxy JADES-GS-518794 at z=5.89, detected with JADES JWST/NIRCam imaging in [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 and H$\alpha$ and spectroscopically confirmed with NIRCam/WFSS thanks to the pure-parallel SAPPHIRES programme. The end-to-end velocity offset is $\Delta v=830\pm130$ km s$^{-1}$. Nebulae with such large size and high luminosity (25-pkpc diameter, L[O III] = $1.2\times 10^{10}$ L$_\odot$) are routinely observed around bright quasars, unlike JADES-GS-518794. With a stellar mass of $10^{10.1}$ M$_\odot$, this galaxy is at the knee of the mass function at z=6. Its star-formation rate declined for some time (10-100 Myr prior to observation), followed by a recent (10 Myr) upturn. This system is part of a candidate large-scale galaxy overdensity, with an excess of Balmer-break galaxies compared to the field (3 $\sigma$). We discuss the possible origin of this nebula as material from a merger or gas expelled by an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The symmetry of the nebula, its bubble-like morphology, kinematics, high luminosity, and the extremely high equivalent width of [OIII] together favour the AGN interpretation. Intriguingly, there may be a physical connection between the presence of such a large, luminous nebula and the possible metamorphosis of the central galaxy towards quenching.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a sample of six F200W and three F277W dropout sources identified as $16<z<25$ galaxy candidates based on the deepest JWST/NIRCam data to date, provided by the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) and the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public survey (NGDEEP), reaching 5$\sigma$ depths of $\sim31.5$ mag (AB) at $\geq2$ $\mu$m. We estimate ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions and densities at $z\sim17$ and $z\sim25$. We find that the number density of galaxies with absolute magnitudes $-19<M_\mathrm{UV}<-18$ (AB) at $z\sim17$ ($z\sim25$) is a factor of 4 (25) smaller than at $z\sim12$; a similar evolution is observed for the luminosity density. Compared to state-of-the-art galaxy simulations, we find the need for an enhanced UV-photon production at $z=17-25$ in $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{DM}=10^{8.5-9.5}$ M$_\odot$ dark matter halos, maybe provided by an increase in the star formation efficiency at early times and/or by intense bursts fed by very low metallicity or primordial gas. There are few robust theoretical predictions for the evolution of galaxies above $z\sim20$ in the literature, however, the continuing rapid drop in the halo mass function suggests more rapid evolution than we observe if photon production efficiencies remained constant. Our $z>16$ galaxy candidates present mass-weighted ages around 30 Myr, and attenuations $\mathrm{A(V)}<0.1$ mag. Their average stellar mass is $\mathrm{M}_\bigstar\sim10^{7}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, implying a star formation efficiency (stellar-to-baryon mass fraction) around 10%. We find three galaxies with very blue UV spectral slopes ($\beta\sim-3$) compatible with low metallicity or Pop III and young ($\lesssim10$ Myr) stars and/or high escape fractions of ionizing photons, the rest presenting slopes $\beta\sim-2.5$ similar to $z=10-12$ samples.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) have been explored as potential dark matter candidates, with various astrophysical observations placing upper limits on the fraction $f_\mathrm{PBH}$ of dark matter in the form of PBHs. However, a largely underutilized probe of PBH abundance is the temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM), inferred from the thermal broadening of absorption lines in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of quasar spectra. PBHs inject energy into the IGM via Hawking radiation, altering its thermal evolution. In this work, we constrain this energy injection by self-consistently modeling its interplay with the cosmological ultraviolet background from galaxies and supermassive black holes. Leveraging IGM temperature measurements spanning the past twelve billion years ($z \sim 0$ to $6$), we derive one of the most stringent constraints on PBH-induced heating from light PBHs within the mass range $10^{15}\unicode{x2013}10^{17}$ g. Specifically, for $M_\mathrm{PBH} = 10^{16}$ g, we find $f_\mathrm{PBH} < 5 \times 10^{-5}$ at 95% confidence, with the bound scaling approximately as $M_\mathrm{PBH}^{4}$ at other masses. Our inclusion of helium reionization and low-redshift temperature measurements strengthens previous IGM-based PBH constraints by an order of magnitude or more. Compared to other existing limits, our result is among the strongest, second only to the constraints from the 511 keV line from the Galactic Centre, but with distinct systematics. More broadly, this study highlights the IGM thermal history as a powerful and independent probe of beyond-standard-model physics.
#### SAPPHIRES: A Galaxy Over-Density in the Heart of Cosmic Reionization at $z=8.47$

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a galaxy proto-cluster candidate (dubbed MACS0416-OD-z8p5) at a spectroscopic redshift of $z\sim8.47$, dating back to $\sim550$Myr after the Big Bang. The observations are part of the JWST Cycle-3 treasury program, Slitless Areal Pure-Parallel HIgh-Redshift Emission Survey (SAPPHIRES) with NIRCam-grism. Using wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) obtained in the MACS0416 parallel field, we robustly confirm nine galaxies at $z_{\rm spec}\sim8.47$ via emission line detections of [OIII]5008A (with $>5\,\sigma$) and tentatively confirm one additional galaxy (at $\sim3\,\sigma$). This discovery represents the highest-redshift, spectroscopically confirmed galaxy over-density known to date, which is $\sim6$--$8$ times more dense than the average volume density of galaxies at the same redshift. Furthermore, a galaxy hosting a low-mass active galactic nucleus (``Little-Red-Dot'') is found as a member, suggesting an early emergence of active, massive black holes and feedback between these black holes and their surrounding environments. We also discuss the spatial structures connecting the galaxy over-density to nearby massive star-forming galaxies (separated by $\sim 5$pMpc, including MACS0416-Y1 and MACS0416-JD. This finding of a massive dark matter halo hosting a galaxy over-density at $z\sim8.5$ is surprising given that our survey covered only a small, random field ($16.5\,{\rm arcmin^2}$) as part of a pure parallel observation. The comparison with cosmological simulations shows that the likelihood of finding such a large-scale structure is $<5\,\%$ under the current galaxy formation scenario and the observed survey volume. Our results demonstrate the power of WFSS observations to build a complete line-emitter sample and suggest an important role for over-densities in enhancing galaxy formation by funneling large-scale gas supplies into small cosmological volumes.

 - **Abstract**
 Various past theoretical considerations and observational efforts suggest the presence of a population of stellar-mass black holes in the innermost parsec of the Galactic centre. In this Letter, we investigate the impact of these black holes on the composition of the embedding stellar population through their direct collisions with the individual stars. Based on the estimated collision rates, we derive an order of magnitude radial density profile of the black hole cluster. The estimates were obtained analytically, considering various possible formation channels for the black holes and the observed present-day properties of the stellar populations in the Galactic centre. We find that the collisions of the stars and the black holes can lead to the depletion of the most massive stars within the S-cluster on a timescale of a few million years. The necessary black hole cluster density is compatible with the recurrent in situ star formation in the innermost parsec of the Galactic centre. We suggest that such a depletion naturally explains the reported lack of stars of the stellar type O and of the Galactic halo hyper-velocity star counterparts within the S-cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 The quenching mechanisms of galaxies are not yet fully understood, but post-starburst galaxies provide one explanation for the rapid transition between star-forming and quiescent galaxies. It is generally believed that the starburst initiating the post-starburst phase is merger-driven, however, not all post-starburst galaxies show evidence of a merger, and recent studies suggest that post-starburst galaxies may be produced by multiple distinct mechanisms. This study examines whether multiple types of post-starburst galaxies actually exist $-$ i.e. whether the properties of post-starburst galaxies are multimodal $-$ using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to cluster post-starburst galaxies based on spectroscopic data. It is suggested that there are three types of post-starburst galaxies, which have dissimilar stacked spectral energy distributions and are separated by their H$\alpha$/[OII]$\lambda$3727 absorption with an accuracy of 91%. A comparison of various galaxy properties (e.g., emission line strengths, mass and age distributions, and morphologies) indicate that the grouping is not just an age sequence but may be correlated to the merger-histories of the galaxies. It is suggested that the three post-starburst galaxy types have different origins, some of which may not be merger-driven, and that all typical galaxies go through the post-starburst phase at turnoff.

 - **Abstract**
 The merger origin long GRB 211211A was a class (re-)defining event. A precursor was identified with a $\sim 1$ s separation from the main burst, as well as a claimed candidate quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a frequency $\sim20$ Hz. Here, we explore the implications of the precursor, assuming the quasi-periodicity is real. The precursor variability timescale requires relativistic motion with a Lorentz factor $\Gamma\gtrsim80$, and implies an engine driven jetted outflow. The declining amplitude of the consecutive pulses requires an episodic engine with an `on/off' cycle consistent with the QPO. For a black-hole central engine, the QPO can have its origin in Lense-Thirring precession of the inner disk at $\sim6-9$ $r_g$ (gravitational radii) for a mass $M_\bullet\leq4.5$ M$_{\odot}$, and $\lesssim 7$ $r_g$ for $M_\bullet>4.5$ M$_{\odot}$ and dimensionless spin $\chi\sim 0.3 - 0.9$. Alternatively, at a disk density of $\sim10^{8 - 12}$ g cm$^{-3}$, the required magnetic field strength for a QPO via magnetohydrodynamic effects will be on the order $B\sim10^{12 - 14}$ G. If the central engine is a short lived magnetar or hypermassive neutron star, then a low-frequency QPO can be produced via instabilities within the disk at a radius of $\sim20 - 70$ km, for a disk density $\sim10^{9 - 12}$ g cm$^{-3}$ and magnetic field $\gtrsim10^{13 - 14}$ G. The QPO cannot be coupled to the neutron star spin, as the co-rotation radius is beyond the scale of the disk. Neither engine can be ruled out -- however, we favour an origin for the precursor candidate QPO as early jet-disk coupling for a neutron star -- black hole merger remnant with mass $M_\bullet>4.5$ M$_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 At present, there is no consensus on whether the spectral break in the cosmic ray flux of all elements around 4 PeV is a general characteristic of the Milky Way or is determined by a combination of factors that significantly affect the energy position of the knee. We argue that considering the anisotropic propagation of cosmic rays within a realistically modeled Galactic magnetic field, along with the acceleration limits in various source populations, allows for an accurate description of local experimental data from LHAASO, Tibet AS$\gamma$, and Fermi-LAT for gamma rays. To demonstrate this, we constructed a diffusion propagation model with a general form diffusion tensor within a two-component magnetic field and determined both the local cosmic ray spectrum and the spectra for specific regions of the Milky Way. We calculated the integral flux of diffuse gamma rays in the inner and outer regions of the Galaxy, finding that the spectral shape of the resulting flux aligns with experimental data.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the properties and relationship between Doppler-velocity fluctuations and intensity fluctuations in the off-limb quiet Sun corona. These are expected to reflect the properties of Alfvenic and compressive waves, respectively. The data come from the Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (COMP). These data were studied using spectral methods to estimate the power spectra, amplitudes, perpendicular correlation lengths, phases, trajectories, dispersion relations, and propagation speeds of both types of fluctuations. We find that most velocity fluctuations are due to Alfvenic waves, but that intensity fluctuations come from a variety of sources, likely including fast and slow mode waves, as well as aperiodic variations. The relation between the velocity and intensity fluctuations differs depending on the underlying coronal structure. On short closed loops, the velocity and intensity fluctuations have similar power spectra and speeds. In contrast, on longer nearly radial trajectories, the velocity and intensity fluctuations have different power spectra, with the velocity fluctuations propagating at much faster speeds than the intensity fluctuations. Considering the temperature sensitivity of COMP, these longer structures are more likely to be closed fields lines of the quiet Sun rather than cooler open field lines. That is, we find the character of the interactions of Alfvenic waves and density fluctuations depends on the length of the magnetic loop on which they are traveling.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze simulation results from the TitanWRF global circulation model to understand the mechanisms that maintain the equatorial superrotation in Titan's stratosphere. We find that the eddies associated with wave activities can transport angular momentum upgradient to zonal flow, leading to acceleration of the equatorial superrotation. The dominant wave modes identified in this study are consistent with previous studies, with zonal wavenumber 1 being the major contributor to the prograde acceleration. Despite the same conclusion of maintenance of equatorial superrotation via wave-mean interactions, we find that the way waves interact with the zonal flow in TitanWRF is slightly different from some other studies. We confirm our previous findings that in TitanWRF this occurs primarily during a dozen or so annual, short-duration (a few Titan sols) angular momentum "transfer events," which have a repeatable seasonal pattern but differ slightly in timing and magnitude between years. This is not the case in the Titan Atmosphere Model (TAM), which found milder angular momentum transfers that produced the strongest acceleration of superrotation around solstice in the upper stratosphere and more continuous year-around acceleration in the lower stratosphere. Despite differences in angular momentum transfer across models, we further find that, similar to the TAM wave analysis results, eddies generated by Rossby-Kelvin instabilities may be the major source of prograde angular momentum for the equatorial superrotation, although TitanWRF may also include contributions from the absorption of vertically propagating equatorial Kelvin waves. This differs from our previous work, which suggested barotropic waves were responsible for TitanWRF's solsticial transfer event.
#### Ignition of weak interactions and r-process outflows in super-collapsar accretion disks

 - **Abstract**
 The collapse of rotating massive (~$10 M_\odot$) stars resulting in hyperaccreting black holes (BHs; "collapsars") is a leading model for the central engines of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and a promising source of rapid neutron capture ("r-process") elements. R-process nucleosynthesis in disk outflows requires the accretion flow to self-neutronize. This occurs because of Pauli-blocking at finite electron degeneracy, associated with a critical accretion rate $\dot M > \dot{M}_{\rm ign}$. We analytically examine the assumptions underlying this "ignition threshold" and its possible breakdown with increasing BH mass $M$. Employing three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with weak interactions, we explore the physical conditions of collapsar accretion disks with $M$ ~ 80-3000 $M_\odot$ over more than a viscous timescale as they transition through the threshold. There is remarkable agreement between our simulations and the analytic result $\dot{M}_{\rm ign}\propto \alpha^{5/3}M^{4/3}$ for $M$ ~ 3-3000 $M_\odot$. Simulations and analytic analyses consistently show that the largest BHs leading to r-process nucleosynthesis at $\dot{M}_{\rm ign}$ are $\approx 3000 M_\odot$, beyond which self-neutronization ceases, since the disk temperature $T\propto M^{-1/6}$ decreases below the neutron-proton mass difference (~MeV), suppressing the conversion of protons into neutrons. We show that stellar models of ~$250-10^5M_\odot$ can give rise to BHs of $M$ ~30-1000 $M_\odot$ accreting at $\dot M\gtrsim \dot{M}_{\rm ign}$, yielding ~$10-100 M_\odot$ of light and heavy r-process elements per event. These rare but prolific r-process sources in low-metallicity environments are associated with super-kilonovae and likely extremely energetic GRBs. Such signatures may be used to probe Population III stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The coronal heating problem remains one of the most challenging questions in solar physics. The energy driving coronal heating is widely understood to be associated with convective motions below the photosphere. Recent high-resolution observations reveal that photospheric magnetic fields in the quiet Sun undergo complex and rapid evolution. These photospheric dynamics are expected to be reflected in the coronal magnetic field. Motivated by these insights, our research aims to explore the relationship between magnetic energy and coronal heating. By combining observations from Solar Orbiter and SDO with a magnetic field extrapolation technique, we estimate the magnetic free energy of multi-scale energy release events in the quiet Sun. Interestingly, our results reveal a strong correlation between the evolution of free energy and the integrated intensity of extreme ultraviolet emission at 171 Å~in these events. We quantitatively assess the potential energy flux budget of these events to evaluate their contribution to coronal heating. Our study implies a link between photospheric magnetic field evolution and coronal temperature variations, paving the way for further research into similar phenomena.
#### Revisiting the SATIRE-S irradiance reconstruction: Heritage of Mt Wilson magnetograms and Ca II K observations

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate information on long-term variations in solar irradiance, important for understanding the solar influence on Earth's climate, cannot be derived from direct irradiance measurements due to the comparatively short lifetimes of space-borne experiments. Models using measurements of the solar photospheric magnetic field as input can provide an independent assessment of the changes. The SATIRE-S model does just that. Unfortunately, the magnetogram archives used by SATIRE-S to recover irradiance variations are also relatively short-lived and have short mutual overlapping periods, making it difficult to evaluate their consistency. We improve SATIRE-S total solar irradiance (TSI) reconstruction by firstly incorporating magnetograms from the Mt Wilson Observatory as well as unsigned magnetograms reconstructed from Meudon, Rome, and San Fernando Ca II K data, and secondly, by re-analysing all periods of overlaps between the various archives. Our combined daily irradiance reconstruction from all eight input archives returns an excellent agreement with direct measurements of irradiance, in particular we find a correlation coefficient of 0.98 when comparing to TSIS1/TIM (Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor Total Irradiance Monitor) data. The minimum-to-minimum TSI difference between 1976 and 2019 is -0.2$\pm0.17$~Wm$^{-2}$, while the TSI difference between the 1986 and 2019 minima is statistically insignificant (-0.06$\pm0.13$~Wm$^{-2}$). Our analysis also sheds light on the trend shown by the TSI over the so-called ACRIM gap, disfavouring a hypothesised increasing trend in TSI in that period. By including more direct and indirect magnetogram time series, we have made the TSI reconstructed by SATIRE-S more robust and accurate. The new series shows a reduced trend of decreasing TSI over the last half century, which agrees well with most composites of measured TSI.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the null tests of spatial flatness and the flat $\Lambda$CDM model using the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data measured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the cosmic chronometers (CCH) $H(z)$ data, and the Union3 and Pantheon Plus type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) datasets. We propose a novel non-parametric reconstruction of $F_{AP}$, $D_M/r_d$ and $D'_M/r_d$ from the DESI BAO data to perform the $Ok$ diagnostic, and we also conduct the $Ok$ diagnostic using the combination of CCH and SNe Ia data. The novel method avoids the issue of the dependence on cosmological parameters such as the value of the Hubble constant. There is no evidence of deviation from the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, nor is there any indication of dynamical dark energy found in the observational data. Since we employ a non-parametric reconstruction method, all the conclusions drawn in this paper remain robust and agnostic to any cosmological model and gravitational theory.

 Aims. We present a detailed study of the unique SN 2015ap, a very energetic event, notable for its exceptionally high bolometric peak magnitude if compared to other well-know Type Ib supernovae. We analyzed its multi-wavelength light curve, which exhibited a possible period modulation that could result from a geometrical effect. Methods. We analyzed the modulation present at all available bands in SN 2015ap's light curves using a Bayesian approach for measuring the period of variability. Additionally, narrow Ha emission is observed in late-time spectra, exhibiting periodic velocity shifts likely originating from hydrogen gas stripped from a companion and accreted onto the compact remnant. Results. We propose that SN 2015ap's significant light curve modulation arise from accretion onto a neutron star as the remnant of SN 2015ap. Our multi-wavelength observations reveal a sinusoidal modulation with a period of 8.4 days, confirmed by periodic variations in the Ha emission lines. Traditional models of circumstellar medium interactions cannot account for these features due to the unusually high ejection rates required. Using the Taylor-Spruit dynamo model, we suggest that the interaction between accreting matter and the neutron star's magnetosphere could account for the observed periodic modulation. This implies assuming an ejecta-companion interaction because the accretion from fallback ejecta alone would not produce the observed modulation. The binary configuration, characterized by a separation of less than 50 Ro, supports a magnetized neutron star central engine as the primary mechanism, rather than models involving circumstellar material interaction.

 - **Abstract**
 When a fast radio burst (FRB) expands from its source through a surrounding tenuous plasma, it strongly heats and compresses the plasma at radii up to $\sim 10^{14}$cm. The likely central engines of FRBs are magnetars, and their ambient plasma at radii $r\gg 10^{10}$cm is a magnetized $e^\pm$ wind. We formulate equations describing the FRB-plasma interaction, solve them numerically, and provide an approximate analytical picture of the interaction. We find the following: (1) FRBs emitted at $r<r_{\rm stoch}\sim 10^{12}$cm induce fast stochastic heating and strong compression of the wind, sweeping it like a broom. The outcome of this interaction is determined by the energy losses of the radio wave. We evaluate the parameter space where the FRB survives its interaction with the wind. (2) At radii $r>r_{\rm stoch}$, the FRB induces regular heating to the Lorentz factor $\sim a_0$, where $a_0\propto r^{-1}$ is the wave strength parameter. At $r>r_\star\sim 10^{13}$cm, the FRB drives a quasisteady compression wave in the wind, with compression factor $C_\star\approx 1+a_0^2$. Both characteristic radii $r_{\rm stoch}$ and $r_\star$ scale with FRB luminosity $L$ as $L^{1/3}$. FRBs avoid damping if they are released into the wind medium outside $r_{\rm damp}\sim 10^{11}$cm.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the spatial distribution and physical characteristics of molecular clouds in the G24 region, which is located near the intersection of the Milky Way's Galactic bar with the Norma arm and the 3 kpc arm. Utilizing molecular line data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project, including $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O, along with our own observations of HCO$^{+}$ line using the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) 13.7 m telescope, we have revealed the complex architecture of molecular clouds in the G24 region. Seven giant molecular clouds, each with a mass exceeding $10^4$ $M_\odot$ and a typical H$_2$ column density of $10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, have been identified through observations of CO and its isotopes. The conversion factor $X_{\text{CO}}$ for the G24 region is estimated to be 8.25 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$, aligning with the typical values observed in other regions. Adopting the GaussClumps algorithm, we have identified a total of 257, 201, and 110 clumps in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O within G24 region, respectively. The derived physical properties (including effective radius, mass, and virial parameter) indicate that the majority of these clumps are gravitationally bound, with a subset possessing the potential to form massive stars. Examination of gas infall activities within these clumps further suggests ongoing massive star formation. The complex physical and kinematic environment, shaped by the G24 region's unique location within the Milky Way, has limited the clear detection of gas outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of the binary system SDSS J1257+5428 has been described as paradoxical. Here we investigate under which conditions SDSS J1257+5428 could be understood as a descendant of a cataclysmic variable with an evolved donor star, which is a scenario that has never been explored in detail. We used the BSE code for pre-common-envelope (CE) evolution and the MESA code for post-CE evolution to run binary evolution simulations and searched for potential formation pathways for SDSS J1257+5428 that lead to its observed characteristics. For the post-CE evolution, we adopted a boosted version of the CARB model. We find that SDSS J1257+5428 can be explained as a post-cataclysmic-variable system if (i) the progenitor of the extremely low-mass WD was initially a solar-type star that evolved into a subgiant before the onset of mass transfer and underwent hydrogen shell flashes after the mass transfer stopped, (ii) the massive WD was highly or entirely rejuvenated during the cataclysmic variable evolution, and (iii) magnetic braking was strong enough to make the evolution convergent. In this case, the torques due to magnetic braking need to be stronger than those provided by the CARB model by a factor of ${\sim100}$. We conclude that SDSS J1257+5428 can be reasonably well explained as having originated from a cataclysmic variable that hosted an evolved donor star and should no longer be regarded as paradoxical. If our formation channel is correct, our findings provide further support that stronger magnetic braking acts on progenitors of (i) close detached WD binaries, (ii) close detached millisecond pulsar with extremely low-mass WDs, (iii) AM CVn binaries, and (iv) ultra-compact X-ray binaries, in comparison to the magnetic braking strength required to explain binaries hosting main-sequence stars and single main-sequence stars.

 - **Abstract**
 To identify member populations of IC 1396, we employ the random forest (RF) classifier of machine learning technique. Random forest classifier is an ensemble of individual decision trees suitable for large, high-dimensional datasets. The training set used in this work is derived from previous Gaia-based studies, where the member stars are younger than $\sim$ 10~Myr. However, its sensitivity is limited to $\sim$ 20~mag in the $\rm r_2$ band, making it challenging to identify candidates at the fainter end. In this analysis, in addition to magnitudes and colours, we incorporate several derived parameters from the magnitude and colour of the sources to identify candidate members of the star-forming complex. By employing this method, we are able to identify promising candidate member populations of the star-forming complex. We discuss the associated limitations and caveats in the method and for improvment in future studies. In this analysis, we identify 2425 high-probability low-mass stars distributed within the entire star-forming complex, of which 1331 are new detections. Comparison of these identified member populations shows a high retrieval rate with Gaia-based literature sources, as well as sources detected through methods based on optical spectroscopy, Spitzer, $\rm H_{\alpha}/X-ray$ emissions, optical, and 2MASS photometry. The mean age of the member populations is $\rm \sim 2-4~Myr$, consistent with findings from previous studies. Considering the identified member populations, we present preliminary results by exploring the presence of sub-clusters within IC 1396, assessing the possible mass limit of the member populations, and providing a brief discussion on the star formation history of the complex.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent detection of very-high-energy neutrino emission from Seyfert type active galactic nuclei (AGN) provides a new insight into the physics of the AGN central engines. We notice that if high-energy protons responsible for neutrino emission are accelerated close to the surface of the accretion disk, the neutrino flux may have no unambiguously identifiable electromagnetic counterpart. This is because the electromagnetic power released in interactions of high-energy protons would only contribute to the heating of the disk surface and corona above the disk, rather than escape from the source. Given that the heat deposited in the corona is released in the hard X-ray range we notice that there still might be an "indirect" electromagnetic counterpart of the neutrino signal: the hard X-ray flux variability may be strongly or weakly correlated with the neutrino flux variations, depending on the importance of the high-energy proton heating in the disk/corona heat balance. If heating by high-energy protons provides a sizable contribution to the overall corona heating rate, the overall flux of diffuse GeV neutrino background from Seyfert galaxies may be comparable to the X-ray background flux and the high-energy tail of this background can provide a sizable contribution to the astrophysical neutrino flux in the TeV band.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun's outer atmosphere, the corona, is maintained at mega-Kelvin temperatures and fills the heliosphere with a supersonic outflowing wind. The dissipation of magnetic waves and direct electric currents are likely to be the most significant processes for heating the corona, but a lively debate exists on their relative roles. Here, we suggest that the two are often intrinsically linked, since magnetic waves may trigger current dissipation, and impulsive reconnection can launch magnetic waves. We present a study of the first of these processes by using a 2D physics-based numerical simulation using the Adaptive Mesh Refined (AMR) Versatile Advection Code (VAC). Magnetic waves such as fast magnetoacoustic waves are often observed to propagate in the large-scale corona and interact with local magnetic structures. The present numerical simulations show how the propagation of magnetic disturbances towards a null point or separator can lead to the accumulation of the electric currents. Lorentz forces can laterally push and vertically stretch the magnetic fields, forming a current sheet with a strong magnetic-field gradient. The magnetic field lines then break and reconnect, and so contribute towards coronal heating. Numerical results are presented that support these ideas and support the concept of a symbiosis between waves and reconnection in heating the solar corona.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of the sparsity of galaxy clusters can be used to probe the cosmological information encoded in the host dark matter halo profile, and infer constraints on the cosmological model parameters. Key to the success of these analyses is the control of potential sources of systematic uncertainty. As an example, the presence of baryons can alter the cluster sparsity with respect to predictions from N-body simulations. Similarly, a radial dependent mass bias, as in the case of masses inferred under the hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) hypothesis, can affect sparsity estimates. We examine the imprint of baryonic processes on the sparsity statistics. Then, we investigate the relation between cluster sparsities and gas mass fraction. Finally, we perform a study of the impact of HE mass bias on sparsity measurements and the implication on cosmological parameter inference analyses. We use catalogues of simulated galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred project and run a comparative analysis of the sparsity of clusters from N-body/hydro simulations implementing different feedback model scenarios. Sparsities which probe the mass profile across a large radial range are affected by the presence of baryons in a way that is particularly sensitive to astrophysical feedback, whereas those probing exclusively external cluster regions are less affected. In the former case, we find the sparsities to be moderately correlated with measurements of the gas fraction in the inner cluster regions. We infer constraints on $S_8$ using synthetic average sparsity measurements generated to evaluate the impact of baryons, selection effects and HE bias. In the case of multiple sparsities these lead to highly bias results. Hence, we calibrate linear bias models that enable us to correct for these effects and recover unbiased constraints that are significantly tighter than those inferred from single sparsity analyses.
